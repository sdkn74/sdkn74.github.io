									<p>First watch of the night went through pretty easily. Hew was showing Oflan how to sharpen his Yklwa, he doesn't do bad but didn't do any great work sharpening it either. The next watch Kriptek notices Silvertusk dozed off and wakes her up. He didn't ask her, but just went up to her and tried to crack her back for her. She instantly got creeped out and moves to the other side of the camp for the rest of her shift. The final watch Fitz makes Jack a pair of crocodile boots. After the boots were made they both notice 8 Terradons but they don't come down towards us.</p>

									<p>The next morning we create 2 vials of acid and have Fitz hold them. We eat, break down camp, and then head to Camp Vengeance. As we approach the camp we see a watch tower with 4 boats near the makeshift dock, the dock is surrounded by charred human remains and flayed animal carcasses. Oflan tried to smell if there were any major undead smells but doesn't notice anything from the boat in the river. We all decide to just dock up and head into camp and be on guard. As we are tieing up the boat we see guards on the watch tower, they seem to be Chultan and not Yuan-ti thankfully.</p>

									<p>As we approach the walls Silvertusk calls out that she's there to see Commander Breakbone. As she's talking to one of the guards we ask about the bodies and the other guard mentions that the bodies are from people/animals who attempted to raid the camp. As we enter camp Jack and Fitz notice that the moral is a bit downtrodden with medical tents set up and people are just...tired (not super low moral, but they could use a win). As we are escorted into Breakbone's tent we see a male Chondathan noble man. Breakbone instantly starts flying off the handle and almost arrests us as we enter. Silvertusk talks to him and we persuade him that we can help out at camp. He is instant that since we're here we must follow his orders and are now a part of his command. A bit more persuading and he agrees that we can at least help out around here tonight for a place to sleep but if we're still here when he wakes he will make us a part of his command. If we need anything we can talk to his generals Ord Firebeard and Perne Salhana.</p>

									<p>We decide to get out of the tent as soon as possible. Oflan starts healing people, Kriptek is going around purifying food and water, Fitz is fixing stuff around the camp, and Jack is on the wall helping keep guard. As Jack is keeping guard he sees 3 large gorilla looking zombies with 4 arms (Girallon Zombie) charging the camp. We brace for a fight and during the fight a guard (Matt Damon) hits a nat 20 to do a solid 4 damage a Girallon. Also during the battle Kriptek jumped down off the wall to attempt to hold back the Girallons. He was quickly swarmed by all 3 and was knocked out. As he rolled saving throws he failed, used inspiration to re-roll and rolled a nat 20. On his final roll he rolled a failure and died.</p>

									<p>After the battle we rush down to see if Kriptek is still alive and realize he is not. We do some rites of passage (Jack leading with Tymora's rites with Oflan performing Zou's rites afterwards as well). Knowing the further inland we go the rougher things will be we grab Kriptek's items and put them in our bag of holding. After performing all the rites while back in the camp we start eating some food and realize that the food and water were purified by Kriptek and get a little depressed. We take a long rest for the night and get ready to head out at first light.</p>
