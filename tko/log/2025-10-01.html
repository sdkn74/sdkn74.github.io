									<p>After getting our magical items from the chest on the boat we head back to the crew to see how they are. They mention that they're extremely exhausted so they're going to need a couple days of recuperating with the rations and water we gave them to get their strength up to leave the ship. While we're discussing this with the crew Jack hears 8 Ghouls below us with the mark of Ras Nsi on their foreheads (Blue Triangle). Artus and Dragonbait go to the middle section of the ship and Artus tries to knock three arrows to fire at once. His bowstring snaps and causes him to drop his bow into a group of 4 Ghouls below. They don't notice and we talk about possibly waiting for the Ghouls to move on before we retrieve the bow and prepare to head out. Artus pulls Steve to the side as the rest of us are talking strategy and convinces him to cast a fireball down in one of the groups saying that the Ghouls could be there for hours up until even the next day. We all hear the fireball go off and get really defensive about what just happened. Jack decides if we're going to cast magic he wants to join and pulls out the Wand of Wonder. He ends up shrinking himself which causes Yormash to laugh hysterically as this seems to keep happening to Jack. As we look at the damage the fireball did, we see two Ghouls are down and two are badly burned but still up. The other group of four Ghouls notice what's going on and they all start to move towards the tree holding up the shipwreck. Steve casts Magic Missile on the two he hurt before while Yormash spreads his wings to grab Artus's bow. As he brings the bow back up he lets him know that the bowstring is snapped and tries to hand him two daggers. Artus gives a dagger back bringing out his own dagger with a glowing blue gem in the hilt, "I call this Bookmark". We all go down to fight.</p>

									<p>As the battle finishes we all smell a scent of roses (Dragonbait is disappointed/sad that he was unable to actually fight any of the Ghouls as we killed them too fast). Yormash grabs everyone one at a time and takes them back up to the ship except Artus. As Yormash is bringing up Dragonbait Artus casts Dimension Door and get's back up to the ship desk and yells out "That's why she's called Bookmark". Yormash and Steve decide to go foraging for extra food for the crew and the party but starts accidentally picking poison berries. Steve points this out and shows Yormash the berries he should be picking. Yormash tries to play this off about how he forgot that other species can't handle the berries. Steve tries to eat one and almost shits his pants but holds it in but let out a terrible smelling burp. Yormash decides he doesn't want to be around if Steve can't handle the berries and runs back to the ship. During this time Fitz and Artus go hunting. Artus points out a deer and Fitz decides to try to shoot it with an arrow at the same time as Artus. Artus's arrow was going true for the heart but Fitz's arrow gently nudges Artus's arrow out of the way for the kill. Artus was going to mention that he had the kill be decides to be the bigger man and congratulate Fitz on the kill. As they start cutting out some meat Fitz is tasked with being the lookout for Zombies as they will smell the kill. Fitz notices the Zombies and so he and Artus start booking it back to the ship and they arrive right when Steve and Yormash do.</p>

									<p>We all decide to try to cook the meat and when we start talking about the oven one of the crew mentions that it is... unusable due to the food that he had before going right through him. We then decide to go to the third piece of the shipwreck and go below deck to try to start a fire since it's raining. Steve somehow misses the kindling with a Firebolt and almost sets the boat on fire. Dragonbait smells like wood/smoke (the smell of pity) and Yormash passes a tinderbox to Fitz. Somehow Fitz is unable to get the kindling alight either so Artus tries his luck and fails as well. Dragonbait now smells like fresh baked bread (mad/upset) and Artus gives him his rations and comforts him as we decide to set up camp on the ship. All three watches overnight were uneventful. The next day we have storms again but we notice the crew had a rain catcher so we use the Alchemy Jug for Mayo. Fitz uses Purify Food/Drink to purify the water and we decide to just set the whole third piece of the ship on fire to cook food inside that with Yormash using his wings to go in and out to get food as it's finished. The ship's crew talk about going North through the Aldani Basin and Yormash warns that the Aldani are lobster folk, and if you stay out of their home they'll leave you alone. We decide we're going to head directly South, then Southeast to get to Omu (5 day trip).</p>
