									<p>Camp Vengeance is 4-6 days away and we need 2 gallons of water per day. The first day it starts pouring rain and we keep moving while it's raining. We see 4 swarms of Quipers (Piranha like creatures) and they aren't in Volo's book. To learn more about them Jack decides to try to fish one of them in by noodling his arm. He gets bitten by one fish for 15 points of damage and yanks his arm out of the water. We figure out the Quipers have hearty scales (resistant to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage) and they are immune to restrain, grapple, and stun conditions. After the damage is done Jack rips off the fish and tries to throw it past people's heads and smacks Hew in the head for 6 points of damage. Hew gets snippy with Jack for messing around and Oflan heals Jack for 6 points of healing to help with his wounds.</p>
										
									<p>The rest of the day went by pretty uneventfully and we find an embarkment as evening approaches. We set up camp, have some rations, and have a nice peaceful uneventful night. The next morning we forage for some food but find nothing. We get our water purified since the day doesn't look like rain and we prepare to set off.</p>
										
									<p>This time we head out at a faster pace to make up some time from going slower the day before. As we're traveling down the river we spot two dinos in the water and book it to shore. While we're waiting for them to leave Jack and Kriptek go scavenging for food/supplies. While out they find 2 giant boars and decide to pounce on one to get food. They take the boar down quickly and get 40ish rations from the boar. As they come back Fitz starts showing off the fishing pole he crafted. We're pushing back out into the river when Hew mentions how usually the right side bank is the safer side and we should stick to that side when getting off the river. Just as the afternoon trip down the river begins we see 6 Yuan-ti and decide to pick up the pace after remembering how wonderfully they treated us in Port Nyanzaru. They don't like us leaving and decide to pull out short bows and fire on us. Some of us get hit and we fire arrows and spells back at them. They try to charm us and almost get Hew but we get away before things go downhill too quickly. The rest of the day goes by smoothly and we stop to make camp for the day and get a long rest.</p>
										
									<p>The next day it looks like rain so we set up the rain catcher. About halfway through the day we see 2 zombie ogres on the banks to the left and we all paddle as quickly as we can to get out of range of them ASAP. The rest of the day was quiet, almost like the rain was keeping everything bunkered down. We don't find a great place to set up camp so we end up in a mostly open field. Besides not having cover we have a quiet night and get ready to travel the next morning. The weather is steady rain but nothing too strong where it would impact travel but that means it won't mask our sounds much either. About an hour into the day we see a big wooden box on the shore and as we get near Jack jumps out directly onto the short to grab the box. As he's back in we see there are 4 potions of healing in there and we split them up among the adventuring party. As we're heading off Hew points out tiny creatures in the bushes called Chwingas which are tiny elemental creatures/spirits. The rest of the day is smooth and we find a great alcove to shelter in for the night.</p>
										
									<p>The next day as we're on the river Zhent (humanoid) is on the shore with a flying snake pet. They're with a priest, 8 people who look suspiciously like thugs, and 2 tribal warriors. They try to get us to pull off the river but we're suspicious of the group. We paddle backwards a bit to slow our trip down the river to talk to them but don't get off the river. They mention they're looking for Artus and we mention that we only talked to him for a quick bit back in Port Nyanzaru. We gave him some of the info we knew but don't mention the ring of ice or anything like that, then we continue on down the river.</p>
										
									<p>We see Camp Righteous up ahead and see that it's abandoned but there is a temple. We dock at the camp and decide to expore the area. We notice the commander tents are empty, Jack sees a bird in a pen (fledgling Axebeak, flightless bird). While investigating the temple we notice it has a symbol to Thorm. While investigating the latrine area Jack finds a dead templar and helps bury them with their war hammer but takes the 5 gemstones (worth 10gp each). We decide we'll need to explore the temple or set up camp for the night next session</p>
