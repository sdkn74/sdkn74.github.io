									<p>After resting with the Kobold eggs Jack keeps going down the tunnel towards the tracks. As he reaches the tunnel for the tracks he sets off a trap and a giant wooden claw slams him into the wall. He brushes himself off and peers over the edge towards the bottom of the mine to see if anyone heard him set off the trap. After not seeing any movement he starts walking back and trips another trap and a large stone ball chases him Indiana Jones style until he dodges out of the way and the ball continues on to the second level. Jack then convinces Kanye to yell down like he's one of the Kobolds and that he accidentally set off the traps but we notice right away that his acting isn't good and we know that they know it wasn't one of them.</p>

									<p>We decide to take the tracks back up and retrace our steps a bit to see what's in a side area of the mine. We immediately see there are char marks on the wall so Oflan preemptively blesses the party. Right after Jack sees a skeleton on the ground and smashes it which initiates combat with 6 specters. (He's really not having a good day, that Unlucky foot of the West).</p>

									<p>After the battle Jack finds a Mythril breastplate and gives it to Merek. We decide to head out of the mine for the night since we're close to the entrance. As a few of us are smoking (Oflan, Kanye, Fitz) Kanye finds and captures a skunk for use to throw at enemies later. The night was uneventful thanks to Fitz's alarm spell and the next morning is a beautiful sunny morning. We use the Alchemy Jug for water and Merek fails to hunt a deer. We then go back into the mine and as we descend past where we were before Jack keeps his eyes open for traps. We round a corner and Jack fails to throw a spear at one of the two Kobolds and that initiates another battle. One gets away and runs down some stairs and as we get to the bottom we see so many more ready for a fight (like easily over 10, probably 15). Fight. One Kobold gets away and we plan our next moves</p>
