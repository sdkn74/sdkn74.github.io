									<p>During breakfast Fitz gives Jack some Goggles of Night to give him Darkvision. While Fitz is showing off his cool new crossbow he shoots it into the ceiling and we all....calmly, definitely calmly, tell him to put it down. But the biggest news is that he made us all a bag of holding. Hew is hanging out with us during all of this and Fitz is asking him about the travel routes and the fact we're looking for the Soul monger. While eating alarms start blaring and Hew throws down some coin and goes to see what the commotion is while we follow.</p>

									<p>We keep following the alarms and see that the Temple of Tymora (luck goddess) is under attack from a Ghoul, 5 Zombies, and 6 Skeletons who are trying to break down the door to the temple. We fight them off and during the fight Taban showed up to help out. After the battle we gather up 5 gallongs of Tej (fermented honey wine) and 2 health potions. Before leaving the temple Jack and Oflan donate gold to Tymora's temple. Fitz and Kriptek talk to Hew and we all but Jack decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard. After praying to Tymora, Jack starts making his way back. On his way back he happens to stp in a puddle and soaks his boot.</p>
