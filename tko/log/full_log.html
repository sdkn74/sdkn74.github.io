										<h1>2024-06-26 (The Beginning)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>We start off the campaign with the basics of the campaign. Plaguing the land of Chult is the Death Curse. This curse causes all who die to die for good, no chance at revivify, no miracles, nothing. Our party was answering the call from  Syndra Silvane to stop the Soulmonger (a necromatic artifact) affecting Chult. We all land in Port Nyanzaru with a waterskin full of wine. The air is hot, humid, and rainy in the way a hot summer rain makes things worse and not cooler.</p>
									<p>We spend most of our time exploring the port town and taking in the sights and the town. As we explore we find out that to explore the island of Chult we'll need to find a guide and will most likely need to find a way down the river as that will be the fastest way to travel. As we learn about the guides we decide to go with Hew Hakinstone. He has no left arm and is looking for revenge against Tinder (a red dragon at Wyrmheart Mine). We had to talk to Jobal the guide "licenser" to get Hew. We agree to help him fight Tinder and then he can help us find the Soulmonger. During the town exploration we also discover the following places below.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Locations</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Kaya's Repose: A place to get better rest but at 2x the cost</li>

										<li>Unicorn Sneeze: A potion shop</li>

										<li>Jack of All's: Survival store</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>After getting a guide and hearing about the Dino races the next day we decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard for some drinks. We're talking to Ms. Man in the pub and she mentions that if we put a bet on the dino races for her she'll help us out afterwards. We then head to bed to get an early start to the next day.</p>

										<h1>2024-07-10 (Dino Races)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As we wake up after getting settled in we hear the town buzzing for the Dino Races. As we're going to go find a place to make wagers we're approached by a crazy guy yelling about snake men and how they are trying to revive the ancient god under the city. There are three races that we bet on.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>4 legged race (drag race style)</li>
										<li>2 legged race (drag race style)</li>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>As the race ends and we're celebrating our friend's victory a barrel is thrown at us and does 9 damage to Fitz and Oflan. The one who threw it was a Yuan-ti (Snake-person) and the throw seems intentional. K'lahu (female chultan) saw what happened and asked if we were ok. During our talk with her she mentioned that there is a "low life" not paying their debt to her after the race. If we can help her collect we can get 10% of the 500gp if we help.</p>

									<p>We head out to find a gladiator chultan (Taban) and once we approach his place he starts giving us a hard time and he tries to intimidate us into backing away. We aren't intimidated and Jack goes into a rage to try to intimidate him, this causes Taban to throw K'lahu off the porch and we launch into a battle.</p>

									<p>After the battle we get 1 of the 10 precious gemstones worth 50gp. On our way back we're chatting with K'lahu and we hear <a href="/tko/rumors.html">a couple of rumors from her.</a></p>

									<p>It's now dusk so we go to see Ms. Man. She says that if we're still in town in 3 days we can get a discounted heatlh potion from her for the dino race bet we helped her out with. We then head to the Thundering Lizard and Fitz get's a crossbow. We then head to sleep.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Rewards and experience.</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>50xp for the Dino Races (150xp total)</li>
										<li>150xp for the Taban fight (300xp total)</li>

										<h1>2024-07-24 (Tymora)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>During breakfast Fitz gives Jack some Goggles of Night to give him Darkvision. While Fitz is showing off his cool new crossbow he shoots it into the ceiling and we all....calmly, definitely calmly, tell him to put it down. But the biggest news is that he made us all a bag of holding. Hew is hanging out with us during all of this and Fitz is asking him about the travel routes and the fact we're looking for the Soul monger. While eating alarms start blaring and Hew throws down some coin and goes to see what the commotion is while we follow.</p>

									<p>We keep following the alarms and see that the Temple of Tymora (luck goddess) is under attack from a Ghoul, 5 Zombies, and 6 Skeletons who are trying to break down the door to the temple. We fight them off and during the fight Taban showed up to help out. After the battle we gather up 5 gallongs of Tej (fermented honey wine) and 2 health potions. Before leaving the temple Jack and Oflan donate gold to Tymora's temple. Fitz and Kriptek talk to Hew and we all but Jack decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard. After praying to Tymora, Jack starts making his way back. On his way back he happens to stp in a puddle and soaks his boot.</p>

										<h1>2025-01-08 (Merek who?)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As we're setting up camp Hew and Oflan took first watch. We heard a rustle in the bushes and a 6ft human fell into our camp. Hew and I wake the others and kinda grill him about who he is and why he's here of all places. He starts asking us questions back and we ask if he's heard of the soul monger. He mentions that he has and Orlongu might be a place to get more information. He mentions that he was kinda roped into trying to help while he was in port. We decide to test his mettle to see if we think he'll help out the squad instead of holding us back. Jack throws some rations in the air and Merek hits each piece with no problem. </p>
									<p>The second watch is Merek and Fitz, we decide that having someone we know on watch with the new guy makes the most sense. They chit chat and Fitz shows Merek the body of Kriptek (who we're trying to revive). As Merek and Fitz talk about crafty stuff a vine reaches from the shadows and tries to get Fitz's leg. As he avoids the vine Merek notices the vine as well and they then roll initiative for the fight. During the first round they yell out to wake up the rest of the party.After killing the vine the second watch finishes with the Steel Defender mended and Fitz getting healed.</p>
									<p>Third watch is Jack by himself and he smells the overwhelming stench of death and hears the shuffling of feet. He quietly wakes us all up and both myself and Merek notice 9 Ghouls and a Ghast. The Ghast is leading the ghouls and it has a blue triangle tattooed on it's forehead dictating that it served Ras Nsi (Ras Nsi was a chultan palidan and tried to conqure people with an undead army and was removed of his god given power). We fight off the undead and all collapse back into bed and somehow get a long rest.</p>

										<h1>2025-01-22 (A wicked witch, maybe?)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Oflan prays to their god to give out info on everything we are encountering so we can send this over to other people within our faith. We pack up after breakfast and we are moving up the mountain pass, we only have to go up 3 miles to get to the village. Jack and the metal defender help us less dexterous people with the rough terrain. As we're about 2 miles up the path we clear the treeline and Fitz and I see 3 different points of interest.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>South East - Heart of Ubtao (massive chunk of earth and rock hanging about 200 feet above the ground)</li>
										<li>West - Ziggarat (Pyramid) is at Orlongu</li>
									    <li>South - Wreck of the Star Goddess (shipwreck in the jungle, a wooden vessel in tree branches broken into 3 chunks)</li>
									</ul>
									<p> As we finish the final mile and approach the Ghost Village we notice that the entrance is littered with bleached bones of people. The only thing left standing past the entrance is a hut with thatch and leather over a giant dead reptile ribcage. Around the hut there is a shuffling human figure but they're moving in an almost animalistic manner. We assume this is the witch and we decide to approach (Oflan, Jack with Kriptek's body on his shoulder, and Fitz). We introduce ourselves and her face is so gaunt and old that she almost looks undead. Whiel talking to the witch about the ceremony she says she needs us to perform a task and then gather the material ingredients for the ritual.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Kill the pterrafolk nest (south side, deal with it first)</li>
										<li>A lock of hair or some fingernails from Breakbone (not needed necessarily but definitely wanted)</li>
										<li>Need the corpse of the humanoid we're trying to revive</li>
										<li>A gemstone worth 100 gold or more</li>
										<li>A sacrifice of another live humanoid</li>
									</ul>
									<p>As we hear all this we decide to finally ask the witch's name and she say's it's "Nanny Pu'pu". Fitz asks how the ritual circumvents the death curse and she mentions that the person would be brought back to life. They wouldn't need food or water or sleep and they are not permanently brought back to life. She mentions that if we bring them back to life and solve the death curse this could be a permanant solution. The witch is asking for all of us to come to her so we can all get pointed in the right direction. We aren't sure exactly if we want to sacrifice someone so we decide to go after the terrafolk and go from there. As we head to the south to find the nest we see a chute 70 feet back from the edge of the platue that goes down 30 feet. It's a tight squeeze but if you're a medium creature with light or no armor you can fit. Fitz uses the rope of climbing to anchor it and set 1ft knots to give advantage going back up. We decend and we find ourselves in a triangle cavern with a 30ft wide mouth out the sied of the platue and goes back 60ft to the chute we are decending. We find 9 pterrafolk who are wanting to fight.</p>
									<p>After the fight we still need to investigate the cavern</p>
