										<h1>2024-06-26 (The Beginning)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>We start off the campaign with the basics of the campaign. Plaguing the land of Chult is the Death Curse. This curse causes all who die to die for good, no chance at revivify, no miracles, nothing. Our party was answering the call from  Syndra Silvane to stop the Soulmonger (a necromatic artifact) affecting Chult. We all land in Port Nyanzaru with a waterskin full of wine. The air is hot, humid, and rainy in the way a hot summer rain makes things worse and not cooler.</p>
									<p>We spend most of our time exploring the port town and taking in the sights and the town. As we explore we find out that to explore the island of Chult we'll need to find a guide and will most likely need to find a way down the river as that will be the fastest way to travel. As we learn about the guides we decide to go with Hew Hakinstone. He has no left arm and is looking for revenge against Tinder (a red dragon at Wyrmheart Mine). We had to talk to Jobal the guide "licenser" to get Hew. We agree to help him fight Tinder and then he can help us find the Soulmonger. During the town exploration we also discover the following places below.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>After getting a guide and hearing about the Dino races the next day we decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard for some drinks. We're talking to Ms. Man in the pub and she mentions that if we put a bet on the dino races for her she'll help us out afterwards. We then head to bed to get an early start to the next day.</p>

										<h1>2024-07-10 (Dino Races)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As we wake up after getting settled in we hear the town buzzing for the Dino Races. As we're going to go find a place to make wagers we're approached by a crazy guy yelling about snake men and how they are trying to revive the ancient god under the city. There are three races that we bet on.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>4 legged race (drag race style)</li>
										<li>2 legged race (drag race style)</li>

									</ol>


									<hr class="major" />

									<p>As the race ends and we're celebrating our friend's victory a barrel is thrown at us and does 9 damage to Fitz and Oflan. The one who threw it was a Yuan-ti (Snake-person) and the throw seems intentional. K'lahu (female chultan) saw what happened and asked if we were ok. During our talk with her she mentioned that there is a "low life" not paying their debt to her after the race. If we can help her collect we can get 10% of the 500gp if we help.</p>

									<p>We head out to find a gladiator chultan (Taban) and once we approach his place he starts giving us a hard time and he tries to intimidate us into backing away. We aren't intimidated and Jack goes into a rage to try to intimidate him, this causes Taban to throw K'lahu off the porch and we launch into a battle.</p>

									<p>After the battle we get 1 of the 10 precious gemstones worth 50gp. On our way back we're chatting with K'lahu and we hear <a href="/tko/rumors.html">a couple of rumors from her.</a></p>

									<p>It's now dusk so we go to see Ms. Man. She says that if we're still in town in 3 days we can get a discounted heatlh potion from her for the dino race bet we helped her out with. We then head to the Thundering Lizard and Fitz get's a crossbow. We then head to sleep.</p>

										<h1>2024-07-24 (Tymora)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>During breakfast Fitz gives Jack some Goggles of Night to give him Darkvision. While Fitz is showing off his cool new crossbow he shoots it into the ceiling and we all....calmly, definitely calmly, tell him to put it down. But the biggest news is that he made us all a bag of holding. Hew is hanging out with us during all of this and Fitz is asking him about the travel routes and the fact we're looking for the Soulmonger. While eating alarms start blaring and Hew throws down some coin and goes to see what the commotion is while we follow.</p>

									<p>We keep following the alarms and see that the Temple of Tymora (luck goddess) is under attack from a Ghoul, 5 Zombies, and 6 Skeletons who are trying to break down the door to the temple. We fight them off and during the fight Taban showed up to help out. After the battle we gather up 5 gallons of Tej (fermented honey wine) and 2 health potions. Before leaving the temple Jack and Oflan donate gold to Tymora's temple. Fitz and Kriptek talk to Hew and we all but Jack decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard. After praying to Tymora, Jack starts making his way back. On his way back he happens to stp in a puddle and soaks his boot.</p>

										<h1>2024-08-21 (Unlucky foot of the West)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>After the fight at Tymora's Temple we were all back at the Thundering Lizard with Hew and Taban. We notice 2 people walk in, a female half-orc priest (Undril Silvertusk) and a male human (Volo) with a book under their arm. The priest is wearing a Torm medallion. Torm was a fallen soldier in the holy wars who became a God after death. We decide to invite them over and talk with them for a bit. Undril is trying to get some bags/supplies to Camp Vengeance, specifically for Commander Niles Breakbone. We mention that we're heading that way and we're happy to accompany her to the camp. While talking to Volo we buy his Monster Guide (50gp) with the intention of getting at least 3 new monsters documented for him in where he'll give us our money back.</p>

									<p>After resting up we go looking for a canoe to go down river and Hew mentions we need to talk to Ekene-Afa. On our way we hear another rumor that the Yuan-ti have a temple on the island and are looking to revive their god by sacrificing people of the island. As we reach Ekene-Afa we reserve a canoe to be picked up the next day at noon and look at the items she has for sale. Everything is pretty expensive but we do get a rain catcher to help us gather water on our journey. We head back for the day unlucky things keep happening to Jack and he names himself the "Unlucky foot of the West". That night we see a human male (Artus Cimber) and his Saurial companion (Dragonbait). They mention they were on their way to Orolunga but their Yuan-ti guide abandoned them. We learn from them that Camp Righteous is near Camp Vengeance and hear the history of the area. While talking with them both Jack notices that Artus has a ring that's always covered in frost and he also has tattoos that say "Byrt" and "Lugg". Jack asks about the ring and all that Artus will say is that it's from the jungle and that it was his wife's who had passed. We then wind down for the night in preparation of the next day.</p>

									<p>The next day after breakfast we decide to visit Tymora's temple again. Jack get's a medallion and doesn't stay for the service while Kriptek does. As Kriptek is at the serice Fitz does some tinkering tool stuff on the equipment from the ghoul fight while Oflan has a one person service for Zou and he finds 2 silver pieces afterwards. We head to se Ms. Man and get a discounted health potion and an extra one at normal price. We then head to get the canoe with Brighttusk and she talks more about the Soulmonger and how it siphons souls.There may be red wizards related to it but she's not sure if they're evil or not. They might be in ruins on the island South of River Soshenstar and West of Sky Lizard Mountains. We arrive where we're picking up the canoe and Ekene-Afa's sons Soshen and Tiryk are excited to meet Kriptek since he was the jockey that won the dino races on Nasty Boi.</p>

									<p>We get ready for the trip by dousing up on insect repellant and start heading down the river. We decide to book it for the first 10 miles in the rain. As we start to slow to rest a bit Kriptek notices a bank of blue mist. Hew says it's magic mist and will give you "Blue Mist Fever". Though magical the mist is not controlled by people and is natural phenomenon. We pull off to another bank and find an enbankment with an overhand and a wall to our backs. We then start our shifts for sleeping. On the first watch Oflan notices a flock of four Quetzalcoatluses flying overhead, they don't seem threatening so we let them fly past as we hunker down. We get our long rest and prepare for the next day.</p>

										<h1>2024-09-18 (Survival is harder than it looks)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Camp Vengeance is 4-6 days away and we need 2 gallons of water per day. The first day it starts pouring rain and we keep moving while it's raining. We see 4 swarms of Quipers (Piranha like creatures) and they aren't in Volo's book. To learn more about them Jack decides to try to fish one of them in by noodling his arm. He gets bitten by one fish for 15 points of damage and yanks his arm out of the water. We figure out the Quipers have hearty scales (resistant to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage) and they are immune to restrain, grapple, and stun conditions. After the damage is done Jack rips off the fish and tries to throw it past people's heads and smacks Hew in the head for 6 points of damage. Hew gets snippy with Jack for messing around and Oflan heals Jack for 6 points of healing to help with his wounds.</p>
										
									<p>The rest of the day went by pretty uneventfully and we find an embarkment as evening approaches. We set up camp, have some rations, and have a nice peaceful uneventful night. The next morning we forage for some food but find nothing. We get our water purified since the day doesn't look like rain and we prepare to set off.</p>
										
									<p>This time we head out at a faster pace to make up some time from going slower the day before. As we're traveling down the river we spot two dinos in the water and book it to shore. While we're waiting for them to leave Jack and Kriptek go scavenging for food/supplies. While out they find 2 giant boars and decide to pounce on one to get food. They take the boar down quickly and get 40ish rations from the boar. As they come back Fitz starts showing off the fishing pole he crafted. We're pushing back out into the river when Hew mentions how usually the right side bank is the safer side and we should stick to that side when getting off the river. Just as the afternoon trip down the river begins we see 6 Yuan-ti and decide to pick up the pace after remembering how wonderfully they treated us in Port Nyanzaru. They don't like us leaving and decide to pull out short bows and fire on us. Some of us get hit and we fire arrows and spells back at them. They try to charm us and almost get Hew but we get away before things go downhill too quickly. The rest of the day goes by smoothly and we stop to make camp for the day and get a long rest.</p>
										
									<p>The next day it looks like rain so we set up the rain catcher. About halfway through the day we see 2 zombie ogres on the banks to the left and we all paddle as quickly as we can to get out of range of them ASAP. The rest of the day was quiet, almost like the rain was keeping everything bunkered down. We don't find a great place to set up camp so we end up in a mostly open field. Besides not having cover we have a quiet night and get ready to travel the next morning. The weather is steady rain but nothing too strong where it would impact travel but that means it won't mask our sounds much either. About an hour into the day we see a big wooden box on the shore and as we get near Jack jumps out directly onto the short to grab the box. As he's back in we see there are 4 potions of healing in there and we split them up among the adventuring party. As we're heading off Hew points out tiny creatures in the bushes called Chwingas which are tiny elemental creatures/spirits. The rest of the day is smooth and we find a great alcove to shelter in for the night.</p>
										
									<p>The next day as we're on the river Zhent (humanoid) is on the shore with a flying snake pet. They're with a priest, 8 people who look suspiciously like thugs, and 2 tribal warriors. They try to get us to pull off the river but we're suspicious of the group. We paddle backwards a bit to slow our trip down the river to talk to them but don't get off the river. They mention they're looking for Artus and we mention that we only talked to him for a quick bit back in Port Nyanzaru. We gave him some of the info we knew but don't mention the ring of ice or anything like that, then we continue on down the river.</p>
										
									<p>We see Camp Righteous up ahead and see that it's abandoned but there is a temple. We dock at the camp and decide to explore the area. We notice the commander tents are empty, Jack sees a bird in a pen (fledgling Axebeak, flightless bird). While investigating the temple we notice it has a symbol to Thorm. While investigating the latrine area Jack finds a dead templar and helps bury them with their war hammer but takes the 5 gemstones (worth 10gp each). We decide we'll need to explore the temple or set up camp for the night next session</p>

										<h1>2024-10-02 (We've got a jug of alchemy)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>History of the temple: Early days of the world a Chultan wanted to cross the river but was scared. The crocodile asked the man why he was scared. The man said crocodiles scared him. The crocodile offered to carry the man across the river for a favor and the man reluctantly agreed. The favor the man had to return was to carry the crocodile across to the realm of man which took years. "We will never like crocodiles again" said the man.</p>

									<p>We start going into the temple and we barely make it in before Jack and Oflan fall into a trap. We notice the next one though and avoid it. We come up to a 7 foot wall and help each other over. As we approach the top we see notches in the walls to our left and right where blades look to come from (another trap). A few of us try to pass and Hew reminds us to remember the story of the Crocodile and we decided to put each other on our backs and walk across with no problems. We get to and over another 7 foot wall and make it to the 3rd floor. We have to look at a mirror image of our floor and check for which way to go. We do 4 checks and make it to the next ledge. We see a door with a 4x4 pattern (buttons within the pattern). We press 4-3-3-1 to match our checks across the ground. We see a glyph show up and get Thunderwave cast on us. We decide we need to press all the buttons at the same time with the two people on top of others hitting the top two row's  buttons and the two people on the bottom pressing the bottom 2 row's buttons. The door opens.</p>
										
									<p>We walk in to a 20 foot by 40 foot room with a central pillar. The pillar is 30 feet tall with a beautiful ceramic jug on top. Jack finds a really well preserved femur from a dinosaur next to the pillar (it was used as a club). The pillar has depictions of the man and the Crocodile along it's surface. Fitz casts detect magic and notices the jug is magical. Kriptek picks up the jug and we walk back down the stairs around the pillar. Kriptek drops the jug and Jack picks it up, the room starts to fall apart as we reach the bottom of the stairs. We all run out of the temple and meet back up with Hew. As we're showing off the new jug we hear an arrow thud nearby and find 8 goblins and a goblin chief to fight.</p>
										
									<p>Batiri Goblins attack us and after killing them we look at and inspect the jug more. We find out that it's an Alchemy Jug with 10 possible liquids. The liquid comes out at 2 gallons per minute up to the liquid max. No long rest as we're going to roll for night encounters.</p>

										<h1>2024-11-13 (That's a troll penis)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>First shift of the first night was uneventful. The second shift Kriptek wakes up and drew Fitz while he slept, after he finished he put the well drawn parchment away but Jack noticed this out of the corner of his eye. The third shift Fitz ans Silvertusk notice a being lurking at the end of the night but never approached. In the morning Kriptek, Hew, and Silvertusk pack up camp while Fitz, Jack, and Oflan go look for clues about the creature. We find fur, almost like a Tabaxi's and Oflan tries to look for the creature by shaking a branch yelling "PISS PISS PISS" (nat 1 on the roll) while beating the branch around the thick grass.</p>

									<p>We set the Alchemy Jug to create a vial of poison (2 uses per vial). We then push off into the river. The morning is uneventful but in the afternoon we see at the banks of the near shore is a party of 5 fighting undead. Just as we're coming in to help them they finish off the last undead and Fitz notices they're with the Emerald Enclave. We talk to them for a bit with Father of Mielikki and his 4 scouts (Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde).</p>

									<p>Rumor: Aldani Basin -> The river ends in a marshy swamp. The Aldani are lobster folk, and if you stay out of their home they'll leave you alone. This basin does connect to the river Tath.</p>

									<p>We break for lunch, enjoy a nice relaxing time, and then keep going down the river, it looks like storms again. Staying towards the right side of the river we stop to make camp. Jack catches 4 fish and we have fish and chips for dinner. Hew and I notice 10 Terradons and they're flying lower towards us. We don't know their intentions so Hew grabs a torch and scares them as they're descending. We trade off shifts so Fitz and Kriptek can take watch. As they're watching 4 crocodiles come out and attack Kriptek. We fight them all off successfully and Jack skins the crocodiles to make boots later.</p>

									<p>Hew tells us we have about a full day of travel until we get to Camp Vengeance. It looks to be a sunny day and we use the Alchemy Jug to make poison again. We take it easy down the river and realize we probably don't want to approach the camp at night so we go to set up our own camp about a mile away. As we're approaching the bank we see a giant troll running down towards us. We beat and burn the troll and realize that acid is also a way to prevent the troll from healing itself. We look for anything interesting on the troll and find 50gp and while pulling up the loincloth Jack sees a big ol' troll penis. Hew looks at the boat and thinks it's find but Fitz goes about casting Mending on it just in case and fixes any issues we may not have seen. We go through the rest of the night peacefully and are ready to head to Camp Vengeance the next day.</p>

										<h1>2024-11-26 (What a terrible day for rain)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>First watch of the night went through pretty easily. Hew was showing Oflan how to sharpen his Yklwa, he doesn't do bad but didn't do any great work sharpening it either. The next watch Kriptek notices Silvertusk dozed off and wakes her up. He didn't ask her, but just went up to her and tried to crack her back for her. She instantly got creeped out and moves to the other side of the camp for the rest of her shift. The final watch Fitz makes Jack a pair of crocodile boots. After the boots were made they both notice 8 Terradons but they don't come down towards us.</p>

									<p>The next morning we create 2 vials of acid and have Fitz hold them. We eat, break down camp, and then head to Camp Vengeance. As we approach the camp we see a watch tower with 4 boats near the makeshift dock, the dock is surrounded by charred human remains and flayed animal carcasses. Oflan tried to smell if there were any major undead smells but doesn't notice anything from the boat in the river. We all decide to just dock up and head into camp and be on guard. As we are tieing up the boat we see guards on the watch tower, they seem to be Chultan and not Yuan-ti thankfully.</p>

									<p>As we approach the walls Silvertusk calls out that she's there to see Commander Breakbone. As she's talking to one of the guards we ask about the bodies and the other guard mentions that the bodies are from people/animals who attempted to raid the camp. As we enter camp Jack and Fitz notice that the moral is a bit downtrodden with medical tents set up and people are just...tired (not super low moral, but they could use a win). As we are escorted into Breakbone's tent we see a male Chondathan noble man. Breakbone instantly starts flying off the handle and almost arrests us as we enter. Silvertusk talks to him and we persuade him that we can help out at camp. He is instant that since we're here we must follow his orders and are now a part of his command. A bit more persuading and he agrees that we can at least help out around here tonight for a place to sleep but if we're still here when he wakes he will make us a part of his command. If we need anything we can talk to his generals Ord Firebeard and Perne Salhana.</p>

									<p>We decide to get out of the tent as soon as possible. Oflan starts healing people, Kriptek is going around purifying food and water, Fitz is fixing stuff around the camp, and Jack is on the wall helping keep guard. As Jack is keeping guard he sees 3 large gorilla looking zombies with 4 arms (Girallon Zombie) charging the camp. We brace for a fight and during the fight a guard (Matt Damon) hits a nat 20 to do a solid 4 damage a Girallon. Also during the battle Kriptek jumped down off the wall to attempt to hold back the Girallons. He was quickly swarmed by all 3 and was knocked out. As he rolled saving throws he failed, used inspiration to re-roll and rolled a nat 20. On his final roll he rolled a failure and died.</p>

									<p>After the battle we rush down to see if Kriptek is still alive and realize he is not. We do some rites of passage (Jack leading with Tymora's rites with Oflan performing Zou's rites afterwards as well). Knowing the further inland we go the rougher things will be we grab Kriptek's items and put them in our bag of holding. After performing all the rites while back in the camp we start eating some food and realize that the food and water were purified by Kriptek and get a little depressed. We take a long rest for the night and get ready to head out at first light.</p>

										<h1>2024-12-11 (Oflan can't bargain for shit)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>We start the dreary morning by digging a grave for our companion Kriptek. As we're about halfway through a group of Chultan warriors from camp come out to help. As they're helping one of them mentions that there is a witch that can "bring him back". We press for more information but he mentions that this is only just a rumor but if we're interested we can to the ghost town on top of the plateau (Mbola) and we have to get him there within a week. We are a bit skeptical with the Death Curse affecting the island but we decide we're willing to give anything a try and head off to find Hew and let him know. We decide that since this is off the river we'll stash our boat and make the rest of the trek on foot.</p>

									<p>As we're about to leave we have the Alchemy Jug create more acid and Oflan tries to find the person giving out "go go bean juice". Oflan finds a halfling named Big Ben who is willing to sell some to Oflan for the road trip. As he brings some back he finds the quality lacking and realizes he overpaid for junk juice. We load up Kriptek's dead body into the boat and wrap it up in cloth to prevent freaking people out. Naturally today is a day of heavy rain and storms.</p>

									<p>While we're heading down the river we notice that it's difficult to see anything on the banks of the river. Hew somehow finds a great little cove for the night before we get to the Aldani Basin though. Since all the wood is wet we aren't able to create a fire and rely on rations for dinner. For the first watch Oflan works on sharpening his Yklwa again (though he almost never uses it) with help from Hew. We hear a giant shuffling sound and see a giant snapping turtle as it gets closer. As we're fighting the turtle Jack has a psychotic break (according to this author) and is convinced that Hew and Oflan are the reason the turtle is attacking and that it did nothing wrong. Jack ensures that he does a non-lethal strike on the turtle and when it wakes up he tries to feed it a bunch of fish we caught. SOMEHOW THIS RABBIT IS BLESSED BY TYMORA HERSELF AND ROLLS A NAT 20 ON FEEDING IT AND HAVING IT LEAVE.</p>

									<p>During the 3rd watch Fitz sees torch light approaching us, he wakes us up to prepare for what may come. We talk to the group that approaches us and they say they're a group hunting Ghouls and monsters. We talk for a bit and they mention something about undead and a fire newt. We wish them well on their search and don't offer them up a place at our camp and they head out. Later in the watch Fitz hears a bipedal creature with a rider following the previous hunters but since we don't have a fire he keeps quiet and let's the two pass.</p>

									<p>The next morning we use the Alchemy Jug to make Mayo because why not. Hew puts some in the go go bean juice and we all try the awful concoction. With a few options we decide to stash the canoe right now and start heading to the plateau on foot. Fitz's steel defender is carrying Kriptek while the weather is drizzling. We decide to stay at a normal pace to ensure we don't get lost and day 1 was some good progress with no issues. We create a small fire for the night and all 3 watches are uneventful. The next morning it looks like a cloudless day so we use the Alchemy Jug to create water for ourselves. Again the day was uneventful. The first watch of that night we see 7 adult and 2 young Hadrosauruses, they are largely peaceful and wander off. The rest of the watches are uneventful. For the 3rd day we use the jug for water again, Oflan prays to Zou to explain what has happened and check in. He feels a sense of calm, though he's not sure if it's from being answered or if he's just hoping he's been heard.</p>

									<p>As we approach the plateau Oflan rolls a nat 20 on perception and sees a possible encounter approaching. We see 3 Eblis (bird like creatures that speak common). We talk for a bit and they seem to know information about the plateau. We go back and forth a bit and they are adamant about getting 50gp for information about the town and plateau. Eventually Oflan pays up and we hear that the witch doesn't have a known name, people go up but never come down, and Pterrafolk don't like the village. Since we paid we have advantage on Pterrafolk checks. We decide to have camp at the base of the plateau.</p>

										<h1>2025-01-08 (Merek who?)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As we're setting up camp Hew and Oflan took first watch. We heard a rustle in the bushes and a 6ft human fell into our camp. Hew and I wake the others and kinda grill him about who he is and why he's here of all places. He starts asking us questions back and we ask if he's heard of the Soulmonger. He mentions that he has and Orlongu might be a place to get more information. He mentions that he was kinda roped into trying to help while he was in port. We decide to test his mettle to see if we think he'll help out the squad instead of holding us back. Jack throws some rations in the air and Merek hits each piece with no problem. </p>
									<p>The second watch is Merek and Fitz, we decide that having someone we know on watch with the new guy makes the most sense. They chit chat and Fitz shows Merek the body of Kriptek (who we're trying to revive). As Merek and Fitz talk about crafty stuff a vine reaches from the shadows and tries to get Fitz's leg. As he avoids the vine Merek notices the vine as well and they then roll initiative for the fight. During the first round they yell out to wake up the rest of the party.After killing the vine the second watch finishes with the Steel Defender mended and Fitz getting healed.</p>
									<p>Third watch is Jack by himself and he smells the overwhelming stench of death and hears the shuffling of feet. He quietly wakes us all up and both myself and Merek notice 9 Ghouls and a Ghast. The Ghast is leading the ghouls and it has a blue triangle tattooed on it's forehead dictating that it served Ras Nsi (Ras Nsi was a chultan palidan and tried to conqure people with an undead army and was removed of his god given power). We fight off the undead and all collapse back into bed and somehow get a long rest.</p>

										<h1>2025-01-22 (A wicked witch, maybe?)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Oflan prays to their god to give out info on everything we are encountering so we can send this over to other people within our faith. We pack up after breakfast and we are moving up the mountain pass, we only have to go up 3 miles to get to the village. Jack and the metal defender help us less dexterous people with the rough terrain. As we're about 2 miles up the path we clear the treeline and Fitz and I see 3 different points of interest.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>South East - Heart of Ubtao (massive chunk of earth and rock hanging about 200 feet above the ground)</li>
										<li>West - Ziggarat (Pyramid) is at Orlongu</li>
									    <li>South - Wreck of the Star Goddess (shipwreck in the jungle, a wooden vessel in tree branches broken into 3 chunks)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>As we finish the final mile and approach the Ghost Village we notice that the entrance is littered with bleached bones of people. The only thing left standing past the entrance is a hut with thatch and leather over a giant dead reptile ribcage. Around the hut there is a shuffling human figure but they're moving in an almost animalistic manner. We assume this is the witch and we decide to approach (Oflan, Jack with Kriptek's body on his shoulder, and Fitz). We introduce ourselves and her face is so gaunt and old that she almost looks undead. While talking to the witch about the ceremony she says she needs us to perform a task and then gather the material ingredients for the ritual.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Kill the pterrafolk nest (south side, deal with it first)</li>
										<li>A lock of hair or some fingernails from Breakbone (not needed necessarily but definitely wanted)</li>
										<li>Need the corpse of the humanoid we're trying to revive</li>
										<li>A gemstone worth 100 gold or more</li>
										<li>A sacrifice of another live humanoid</li>
									</ul>
									<p>As we hear all this we decide to finally ask the witch's name and she say's it's "Nanny Pu'pu". Fitz asks how the ritual circumvents the death curse and she mentions that the person would be brought back to life. They wouldn't need food or water or sleep and they are not permanently brought back to life. She mentions that if we bring them back to life and solve the death curse this could be a permanent solution. The witch is asking for all of us to come to her so we can all get pointed in the right direction. We aren't sure exactly if we want to sacrifice someone so we decide to go after the pterrafolk and go from there. As we head to the south to find the nest we see a chute 70 feet back from the edge of the platue that goes down 30 feet. It's a tight squeeze but if you're a medium creature with light or no armor you can fit. Fitz uses the rope of climbing to anchor it and set 1ft knots to give advantage going back up. We decend and we find ourselves in a triangle cavern with a 30ft wide mouth out the side of the platue and goes back 60ft to the chute we are decending. We find 9 pterrafolk who are wanting to fight.</p>
									<p>After the fight we still need to investigate the cavern</p>

									</header>

									<p>While investigating the cavern after the pterrafolk we come across some bodies by the chute. The bodies look like other adventurers and in their backpacks we find 20gp, a silvered dagger, and a potion of greater healing. Besides the bodies there doesn't seem to be anything else there so we decide to head back to Nanny Pu'Pu to tell her the job is done. As we finish the climb back up the chute we see across the way that Nanny is dragging something by her hut entrance. We don't see anyone else standing around and then Oflan asks where Hew went. Realizing what must have happened we rush over and see Hew dead on the ground. Nanny Pu'Pu says that more pterrafolk showed up and attacked them but as we looked at Hew we noticed the claw marks don't line up with the ones on us after the battle. We keep pressing for answers while very unsubtly asking questions that indicate we think she did it. She then announces that we should have just let things go and turns invisible. ROLL INITIATIVE.</p>

									<p>After defeating Nanny Pu'Pu, her flesh golem, and the flying monkeys running away we investigate the hut. We're looking to see if she had written anything down about healing and/or reviving people but her hut was pretty empty. We deduced that she was probably the one killing and eating the people in the village and that the pterrafolk were a threat to further food sources for her. We also notice that she had some items to indicate that she was a worshiper of the Lord of Bones (Myrkel). Fitz decided to cast detect magic and found the Cistern in the middle of the village had something magical in it. The water at the bottom was scummy and black as night. Jack was willing to go down into the depths to find the magical item and we held on to the rope of climbing as he descended. As he approached the water he tested it by splashing it with his hand (learning his lesson from the fish in the river) and nothing happened. He determined that he could enter safely and held his breath while he went down 20ft into a small cavern at the bottom. He grabbed a bag and when he had it in his hands he yanked on the rope to have us pull him up. Since he wasn't out of the cavern he smacked his head against the top of the cavern as we yanked him up. As we help him up he shows us the sack made of human skin and we find the following inside.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>6 Onyx gemstones (50gp each)</li>
										<li>Spell scroll of comprehend languages</li>
										<li>10 Adamantium ingots (10gp each) that are stamped with runes from a Dwarven house/family</li>
									</ul>
									<p>After all this we go to bury Hew and collect from his body 50gp. We dig the grave and lay him down with his axe across his body, as he died fighting and deserves his weapon in the afterlife.</p>

									</header>

									<p>We spend the night in Nanny Pu'Pu's hut and while sleeping Jack had night terrors of Kriptek's death while Jack was running away in a forrest. While he kept running he saw Oflan being overwhelmed by undead, Fitz falling right in front of Jack lifeless, and hears a high pitched laughter from all around. He wakes up the next day and doesn't tell anyone anything that happened.</p>

									<p>We decide that we're going to keep going to the Wyrmheart Mine by sailing around the shore of the island like Hew mentioned to us before. As we're talking about possible areas to go after we realize that the wreck of the Star Goddess could be either a normal water ship or an air ship. We start heading back to where we stashed the canoe when we left the river and Fitz uses that time to make a new robot buddy. The weather that day is one of rain so we don't have to worry too much about water to drink. As we get back to the canoe Jack sees if his "turtle buddy" is still around. He is not (thankfully). As we look closer to the map of the Wyrmheart Mine that Hew had on him we see the name of the young dragon T'Zindelor (nicknamed Tinder).

									<p>Finished long rest at canoe. Found the canoe and everything looks good. We bring it to the basin (stagnet water) and we determine where we need to go to get to the main branch of the river. We get to the river and it's storming. We have to row to move. I notice/hear something familiar and I hear a troll running at us from the shore, we row to the shore at 45° angle to make a stand. We take it down but can't kill it without fire or acid. We push it's decapitated head into the bottom of the river with a rock on top of it. We find camp and determine sleep order. A Oflan sleeps he sees Syndra Silvane in trouble and slowly dying. Oflan prays to his god to try to pray to help her. Oflan asks his friends to help out in the dream as well but only Fitz's robot looks to help. As he does so his eyes turn red and Oflan hears a giant boom and crack and wakes with a start. Oflan looks at the robot buddy to make sure things were just a dream and the robot buddy seems to be hanging out like normal. Oflan goes back to sleep and doesn't dream again.</p>

									<p>The next day we notice that the river is somehow going up in altitude, not super noticeable but over a long stretch of river we are gathering elevation. Jack finds a good camp though it's an older camp that was used in the past. During the 3rd shift we have to deal with crocodiles again. We gather water and food in the morning the next day and set off again. During our travels for the day we see a giant rotting frog with a short sword coming out through it's back. We pull off to investigate and find a dead halfling in the frog's mouth. We take the supplies from the halfling and find the following.</p>

										<li>Potion of Hill Giant Strength</li>
										<li>Magical +1 Short Sword</li>

										<h1>2025-03-12 (Teamwork makes the dream work, right?)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>We head back into the canoe and head down the river, it's about midday. When it get's closer to evening the river levels out in altitude and the water seems to be quicker than it was previously. We end up letting time get away from us and pull off the river around dusk (on the right side of the river, old habits and all). Since the lighting was pretty minimal our campsite is about 10-15 feet from the water backing right up to the jungle. Jack tries fishing but is really struggling while Merek crafts arrows. The first watch is luckily uneventful as Oflan just gets lost in the view of the trees as he just stares into the jungle. Second watch Merek is thankfully alert since Fitz is in the zone "crafting" though nothing approaches camp. Third watch Jack is focused on night fishing but realizes as the sun comes up that he's not holding a fishing rod and it's just a similar sized stick.</p>

									<p>The next day is just a steady rain kinda day, we still end up using the Alchemy Jug for water though. About mid-morning Fitz and Merek see raindrops just suspended in the air further down the river (totally not odd). They then notice that webbing is holding up the raindrops and Fitz sees 4 giant spiders (2 on the left bank and 2 on the right bank). Merek tries to light his arrow on fire but catches his bow string by accident. Jack takes the human skin sack, ties it to the top of his warhammer, then lights it on fire. He throws the sack-hammer at the web and manages to catch it on fire (in the rain no less). As we end up passing by where the web used to be one of the spiders launches web at Fitz. When Oflan and Fitz see the web coming they both attack the spider. The spider seems no worse for wear but Fitz gets restrained by the web. As Merek helps to get Fitz free from the web, Jack and Oflan see a fork in the river. They're a bit conflicted on which fork to go down but decide to go to the left. Once we're on the new part of the river the speed is picking up even more than before. We use the speed to make some good time and the rest of the day is uneventful. We do find a nice little bank for camp and when we empty the rain catcher we have enough water for 2 days.</p>

									<p>As we're setting up camp Oflan looks around for threats and falls into a thorn bush. Fitz casts mending on Mereks bow to help him out. Jack fishes a couple of sunfish but as Jack is trying to file their teeth to trick Volo and put them in the book they slip out of his hands and go back into the river. We all get ready to rest for the night and the first shift is not great for Oflan. He doesn't notice a giant constrictor snake attacking. We end up killing the snake and Oflan heals up quite a bit in case more battles come up. The second shift is uneventful but the third shift Jack and Robo-Buddy hear a gropu of people coming form up river. Jack notices 10 figures that don't notice him, but he knows they will notice camp when they get closer. The figures are 1 hooded figure in the middle with 3 guards in front and 3 guards in back. They are all followed by 3 skeletons a bit further back. As the hooded figure notices camp he strikes up a conversation with Jack and is asking about Omu (ruins/city around here somewhere). He mentions that his name is "Thatcher the mage" and he was sent by Velendra Shadowmantle and that if we find anything out about the death curse or this city to reach out to the group at the Heart of Ubtao.</p>

									<p>After the long rest we start the day with the Alchemy Jug making some acid for us as we have water and it's a stormy day. We notice blue mist starting to approach the river from the left bank and we realize that the blue mist is going to hit the middle of the river just as we would be going through. We decide to pull off for a bit to allow it to pass before trying to go down the river again but Jack wanted to try to rush through and loses his oar. As we're on the bank we notice that we're at the very top of the altitude of the river and we realize that to get back down to sea level we either have to go down a big waterfall or multiple smaller ones. Oflan goes searching for a large branch then gives it to Fitz so he can create a new oar for Jack. Merek goes about 300 feet down the bank and (while not seeing the actual waterfall) thinks that we can survive any waterfall based on how high up we are and the land level below. As we're approaching the waterfall Fitz and Oflan want to pull off to assess what's below while Jack and Merek want to just go over the waterfall and handle things as they come. We can't come to an agreement to Oflan and Fitz jump out of the canoe to get to shore while Jack and Merek go over the edge. The canoe team ends up getting to the bottom without any major incident and the swimming team gets to shore. Upon getting to shore Fitz realizes that he has Featherfall and casts it on Oflan and himself so they can jump to the shore below. As we all get together we argue over what happened and how we're not working together well and can't come to an agreement on choices. Merek bumps into Oflan during the argument and Oflan pushes him back into the river. Merek barely gets out of the river before a swarm of Quippers attack him. We set up camp while Fitz mends the canoe. Oflan regrets losing his temper and realizes this is not following the path Zou has guided him on and as he prays he feels that Zou is listening and he feels like he has the inner peace and strength within himself to help bring the group together.</p>

									<p>The night after the infighting Merek went hunting while Jack went fishing. Jack ended up breaking his rod and really embraced that Unlucky Foot of the West nickname. While hunting Merek saw a hog and tried sneaking up on it but stepped on a giant thorn. He yells so loud at his pain that birds fly up out of the trees and the hog runs off. On his was back to camp he ends up hunted himself by a Kamadan. He yells out for us and luckily back at camp we are able to hear him and rush out to help. After the fight we check to see if a Kamadan is in the book Volo gave us and it is not. We write down the properties of the monster. Snakes protruding from the shoulders, sleep breath attack, claw attack, bite attack, snake tails can bite, snakes are venomous. The monster could be a pack animal and could also not be, we aren't sure. Fitz extracts 2 vials of the vials of sleeping venom in the glands of the leopard head. We decide we've had enough fun for the day and head to bed.</p>

									<p>The first watch Oflan is surprise attacked by a tiny beast with wings (Stirge). As he's about to attack the small beast back he notices 7 more approaching. Oflan is drained of a lot of blood and calls out to his friends for help. During the battle Merek went looking for his +1 long bow that he doesn't have and did try to use his cure wounds as a bonus action. We end the fight a little worn but overall alright. The second watch was pretty uneventful. The third watch Jack notices Chwingas just on the edge of the clearing. He offers them his flying monkey whistle but they don't immediately take it. While Jack isn't looking he later notices that the whistle is gone and a bowl of berries in his tent and feels empowered (he now has 3 uses of darkvision).</p>

									<p>The next day the weather is misty and humid, we decide to make 4 gallons of beer with the Alchemy jug. Oflan asks Merek to speak to him now that tempers have calmed a bit and apologizes for pushing him in the river the day before. Merek also apologizes and both of them make amends and continue on. Oflan is looking out for the ruins and/or the city of Omu. As we continue on the river Merek gets a sense that something is tracking us in the air. He can't see the thing tracking us, but he doesn't get a sense of danger from the thing tracking us. We pull of the river to see if anything happens and Oflan tries to pinpoint the creature with his sense of smell. It becomes apparent the creature is smaller than we thought and as we try to figure out it's location it flies off. The feeling we get from the presence is a playful/good presence after Jack prays to Tymora about it. We decide to just continue on with our travels and later notice all our packs have been switched with one another's. Fitz laughs it off and calls out that this was a great joke. Turns out we had a Donny the Fairy Dragon appear in the air next to us (size of a medium dog) and loved that we enjoyed his tomfoolery. Since we were so willing to play along with him he said he would answer three questions for us. We asked for the location of the Soulmonger and found they were also guarded by Gargoyles and Yuan-ti. We then ask for the location of the ruins we were keeping an eye out for and found out they were up by Orlongu. Finally we ask for any weaknesses for Tinder. We get a lot of information but not a lot on weaknesses. We find out that they're immune to fire, have a fire breath attack, they are strong, they have blindsight and darkvision. They have great CON, WIS, DEX, CHA, and STR abilities plus they have a Kobold army helping them. After thanking Donny he up and left while we put information about the Fairy Dragon to Volo's guide (side quest complete but going to try for more).</p>

									<p>We carry on with our trip and notice the river picking up speed again. This isn't quite waterfall levels of speed thankfully. On the bank we notice a human torso looking like it crawled from the treeline toward the river. Jack isn't particularly interested in checking it out but Fitz and Oflan are interested. The human looks to me a couple of days old and we see a crest of a flaming fist on his breastplate. In his pack were 4 rations, a sleeping bag, a charter of Lord Onovan IV of the Dales, 50gp, and a wand. Oflan gives last rights over the body and feels Zou give him a feeling that he's on the right path. Before we get back into the canoe Fitz casts Identify on the wand to determine it's a Wand of Wonder and Oflan ends up taking the wand. We get back into the canoe and prepare for the rest of the afternoon/day.</p>

									<p>We start the session on the river and Merek notices the river is getting faster like the last time we approached a waterfall. We are paying attention this time and make a plan for the upcoming hurdle. Fitz casts feather fall while Oflan casts bless on the party. We end up making it holding the boat as we fall slowly to the river below. We find ourselves in a giant gorge (Ataaz Kahakla) while Fitz realizes that the gorge is worn down and suddenly remembers that the Wreck of the Star Goddess is in fact an airship. We keep on down the river and exit the gorge and find a forested area across the river from an unnamed mine. We decide to rest for the night. 1st watch is uneventful, the 2nd watch Merek hears multiple footsteps and wakes us all up. We see 12 tribal warriors with a blue triangle on their foreheads (cannibals, tribe of eating Dhjebooty). They are heading up towards Orolunga and ask us some questions. We are vague on where we're going and eventually they leave. The 3rd watch is also uneventful.</p>

									<p>The next day is very rainy and we decide to create 4 gallons of beer with the Alchemy Jug. We decide to enter the mine and Fitz uses magic tinkering to give items of ours 5 feet of bright light and 5 feet of dim light for the non-darkvision people. We're not going stealthily at all and Oflan doesn't smell any undead. We start going down a tunnel and find a big open cavern with a dim light glowing all around the room. The floors are flooded with a sharp outcropping with sharp pipes. The pipes are shooting water our into the pools which create large waves. We hear a "Sup, dudes?!" which echos around the room. Standing on a rock is a black Kobold in the waves as we enter the room. He says that he's into body surfing and if we want to get past him we need to take part in a competition (winner take all). As we line up to body surf Jack launches a sleep vial at the Kobold and he falls unconscious.</p> 

									<p>After we survive the waves and the competition the Kobold tells us about some pirates that hang out in the bay. They have a ship at their home base, a ship patrolling the water, and a ship in the bay. Jack takes himself to the switch to open the door and then gets two critical successes to get back to the Kobold and us. The Kobold introduces himself as Kayne and says that he ows us a wookie life debt. We ask him to teach us how to be better in the water (water checks)</p>

									<p>As we leave the mine it's around lunchtime. Kanye (Kobold) reminds us about the Pirates in Jahaka Bay. Since we're so close to the bay we decided to get some greenery and Fitz made camouflage for the canoe (+5 to stealth checks). Merek decided to go hunting to get us some food for the long journey ahead and manages to nab a boar. Jack and Kanye decide to go fishing as well but both of them end up with nothing. Merek comes back with the boar and cooks it up and we get about 15lbs of meat.</p>
									
									<p>We get onto the canoe and since the pirates were patrolling the bay we decided to stay along the coastline. To help with us sneaking we used the cover of dark to by the pirates. We make it past the Kobold Mountains by daybreak. Oflan, Fitz, and Merek go for a nap as they were up all night. The weather is heavier rain and we made wine with the Alchemy Jug. by nightfall we get to the edge of Shilku Bay. We all pull the canoe over and rest for the night.</p>

									<p>First watch Oflan and Kanye talk about a lot of stuff and the watch was uneventful. Second watch was also uneventful and the third watch was they clocked 5 winged beasts (Pterradons) but they stay above the water. The next morning we used the Alchemy Jug for wine again and the weather is a full on storm. We decide to go inland and hide the canoe and maybe we can come back to it later. We do a decent job hiding the canoe and then start trekking towards the mine. Oflan, Kanye, and Merek end up falling down a steep hill. We finally make it to the clearing right in front of the mine. We make camp and prepare for the watches and Fitz ritual casts "Alarm".</p>

									<p>First watch Oflan and Kanye end up talking. Oflan finds a good bushel of island weed and Kanye and him smoke it. Shenanagins ensue and Oflan makes the fish sticks joke. Kanye totally get it and he spends most of the rest of the shift trying to explain it. When the shift is over Oflan and Kanye try to hide the rest of their stash under the ground and Oflan tries to wake up robo-buddy instead of Fitz because he's so out of it. Second watch Merek and Fitz see the drawings of fish, giant dicks, and odd rectangles. They smell the weed and eventually find Oflan and Kanye's stash. Fitz digs it up and hides it from us (what a punk). Third watch for Jack and robo-buddy was pretty uneventful.</p>

									<p>The next day the weather is light rain and the Alchemy Jug creates wine (shocker). As we wake up Fitz and Merek approach Kanye and Oflan about the weed. Then Kanye gets gifted a pipe from Jack, smokes a bit out of it, and uses the smoke to somehow capture a wasp nest. He also get's a sling for throwing stuff. We came up with a name for our group called "Special K and the Revengers". We approach the mine and notice 2 buildings on either side of the entrance. On the right was a larger building and the left was a smaller building. We decide to investigate the left building and it looks like an overgrown office with nothing inside. The second building on the right and Jack pries open the door and we find some supplies for mine workers. We took a few items and enter the mine.</p>

									<p>As we enter the mine we find a mine cart and decide to wait until we find more before riding them down the tracks. We find a bridge and decide to cross, as we look down we don't see anyone or any other mine carts. As we are approaching the other side we hear echoes of voices across the bridge. Jack crosses stealthily and gets close enough to hear the conversation but doesn't understand it. He knew there were 2 voices and the ended up hearing up sneaking up on them and we attack. After the battle we have 30 brown eggs (Kobold eggs). We talked to Kanye about fighting other Kobolds and what we should do with the eggs. We stopped in 6B (for DM).</p>

									<p>After resting with the Kobold eggs Jack keeps going down the tunnel towards the tracks. As he reaches the tunnel for the tracks he sets off a trap and a giant wooden claw slams him into the wall. He brushes himself off and peers over the edge towards the bottom of the mine to see if anyone heard him set off the trap. After not seeing any movement he starts walking back and trips another trap and a large stone ball chases him Indiana Jones style until he dodges out of the way and the ball continues on to the second level. Jack then convinces Kanye to yell down like he's one of the Kobolds and that he accidentally set off the traps but we notice right away that his acting isn't good and we know that they know it wasn't one of them.</p>

									<p>We decide to take the tracks back up and retrace our steps a bit to see what's in a side area of the mine. We immediately see there are char marks on the wall so Oflan preemptively blesses the party. Right after Jack sees a skeleton on the ground and smashes it which initiates combat with 6 specters. (He's really not having a good day, that Unlucky foot of the West).</p>

									<p>After the battle Jack finds a Mythril breastplate and gives it to Merek. We decide to head out of the mine for the night since we're close to the entrance. As a few of us are smoking (Oflan, Kanye, Fitz) Kanye finds and captures a skunk for use to throw at enemies later. The night was uneventful thanks to Fitz's alarm spell and the next morning is a beautiful sunny morning. We use the Alchemy Jug for water and Merek fails to hunt a deer. We then go back into the mine and as we descend past where we were before Jack keeps his eyes open for traps. We round a corner and Jack fails to throw a spear at one of the two Kobolds and that initiates another battle. One gets away and runs down some stairs and as we get to the bottom we see so many more ready for a fight (like easily over 10, probably 15). Fight. One Kobold gets away and we plan our next moves</p>

									</header>

									<p>We head towards the track from the room where we fought all the people and as we get towards the Northwestern side of the mine we see a dim glow. We go into the room with pillars and Jack fails to notice anyone before he gets attacked. Since we're in torch light we don't have any trouble fighting the 8 winged Kobolds. We continue on into the room towards the north and take a short rest while Kanye gets healed up. We continue down the tracks and with it being so dark we use a congo line strategy to keep in line with those who can see.</p>

									<p>As we get closer to the bottom of the mine there is a loud waterfall which helps muffle our steps. We decide to go into the small pocket on sublevel 2 to poke around. We find 4 wooden masks and 4 dyed Red Dino skins. Jack grabs them and we put them on as we head towards the bottom of the mine. Merek stays on the ledge with Kanye to get an advantage point on Tinder. Oflan stays outside the room with Tinder while Jack and Fitz go in to try to talk to her. It's not looking good so Jack starts to rage and the battle pops off.</p>

									<p>The battle is won but not without casualties. Oflan and Merek don't make it and the others barely survive after Tinder takes us all down with her breath weapon attack.</p>

									</header>

									<p>After defeating Tinder Jack and Fitz go through the dragon's hoard. They find the following.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>12 Breast Plates (1 to Kanye)</li>
										<li>8 Helmets (1 to Kanye)</li>
										<li>9 Shields (1 to Kanye)</li>
										<li>4 Battle Axes</li>
										<li>1 Copper Jug with Jade inlays (Fitz)</li>
										<li>5 Warhammers</li>
										<li>1 Magic Battle axe (named Bob, given to Jack)</li>
										<li>1 Dragon metal gold medallion (Kanye)</li>
										<li>1 Empty gold scabbard (dismantle for 25 gp)</li>
									</ul>

									<p>After going through the hoard they also grab anything important off Oflan and Merek's bodies. They grab a cart to carry their bodies after a long rest. They then craft rafts for a viking style funeral and send them out into the bay. As this happens Yormash comes down the coast and asks them where he can find a group of people with Oflan and Hew as he's been sent by Zou to help Oflan. He mentions that he was traveling with Hew's cousin but that he's been captured by pirates. Jack and Fitz tell Yormash that both Oflan and Hew are dead and Yormash is upset that he cannot get vengeance on the one that killed them. He instead turns his vengeance towards the death curse as that is what forced them to be there in the first place.</p>

									<p>Fitz and Jack get convinced to help Yormash get Hew's cousin off the pirate ship so they start heading back up to where the canoe was stashed. As they all get close to the pirate bay they decide to take a long rest. 1st watch with Jack and Yormash was uneventful. The 2nd watch with Kanye and Robo buddy was uneventful. The 3rd watch with Fitz was very eventful as Fitz was attacked by 9 feathered dinos (small velociraptors the size of a turkey). We end up taking them all out and Yormash takes a moment to smoke with Kanye as he went down twice and seems shaken up. We get our hard earned long rest.</p>
