										<h1>2024-06-26 (The Beginning)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>We start off the campaign with the basics of the campaign. Plaguing the land of Chult is the Death Curse. This curse causes all who die to die for good, no chance at revivify, no miracles, nothing. Our party was answering the call from  Syndra Silvane to stop the Soulmonger (a necromatic artifact) affecting Chult. We all land in Port Nyanzaru with a waterskin full of wine. The air is hot, humid, and rainy in the way a hot summer rain makes things worse and not cooler.</p>
									<p>We spend most of our time exploring the port town and taking in the sights and the town. As we explore we find out that to explore the island of Chult we'll need to find a guide and will most likely need to find a way down the river as that will be the fastest way to travel. As we learn about the guides we decide to go with Hew Hakinstone. He has no left arm and is looking for revenge against Tinder (a red dragon at Wyrmheart Mine). We had to talk to Jobal the guide "licenser" to get Hew. We agree to help him fight Tinder and then he can help us find the Soulmonger. During the town exploration we also discover the following places below.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Locations</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Kaya's Repose: A place to get better rest but at 2x the cost</li>

										<li>Jack of All's: Survival store</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>After getting a guide and hearing about the Dino races the next day we decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard for some drinks. We're talking to Ms. Man in the pub and she mentions that if we put a bet on the dino races for her she'll help us out afterwards. We then head to bed to get an early start to the next day.</p>

										<h1>2024-07-10 (Dino Races)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As we wake up after getting settled in we hear the town buzzing for the Dino Races. As we're going to go find a place to make wagers we're approached by a crazy guy yelling about snake men and how they are trying to revive the ancient god under the city. There are three races that we bet on.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>4 legged race (drag race style)</li>

									<p>As the race ends and we're celebrating our friend's victory a barrel is thrown at us and does 9 damage to Fitz and Oflan. The one who threw it was a Yuan-ti (Snake-person) and the throw seems intentional. K'lahu (female chultan) saw what happened and asked if we were ok. During our talk with her she mentioned that there is a "low life" not paying their debt to her after the race. If we can help her collect we can get 10% of the 500gp if we help.</p>

									<p>We head out to find a gladiator chultan (Taban) and once we approach his place he starts giving us a hard time and he tries to intimidate us into backing away. We aren't intimidated and Jack goes into a rage to try to intimidate him, this causes Taban to throw K'lahu off the porch and we launch into a battle.</p>

									<p>After the battle we get 1 of the 10 precious gemstones worth 50gp. On our way back we're chatting with K'lahu and we hear <a href="/tko/rumors.html">a couple of rumors from her.</a></p>

									<p>It's now dusk so we go to see Ms. Man. She says that if we're still in town in 3 days we can get a discounted heatlh potion from her for the dino race bet we helped her out with. We then head to the Thundering Lizard and Fitz get's a crossbow. We then head to sleep.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Rewards and experience.</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>50xp for the Dino Races (150xp total)</li>
										<li>150xp for the Taban fight (300xp total)</li>
										<li>Level 2 due to experience</li>
									</ul>

										<h1>2024-07-24 (Tymora)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>During breakfast Fitz gives Jack some Goggles of Night to give him Darkvision. While Fitz is showing off his cool new crossbow he shoots it into the ceiling and we all....calmly, definitely calmly, tell him to put it down. But the biggest news is that he made us all a bag of holding. Hew is hanging out with us during all of this and Fitz is asking him about the travel routes and the fact we're looking for the Soul monger. While eating alarms start blaring and Hew throws down some coin and goes to see what the commotion is while we follow.</p>

									<p>We keep following the alarms and see that the Temple of Tymora (luck goddess) is under attack from a Ghoul, 5 Zombies, and 6 Skeletons who are trying to break down the door to the temple. We fight them off and during the fight Taban showed up to help out. After the battle we gather up 5 gallongs of Tej (fermented honey wine) and 2 health potions. Before leaving the temple Jack and Oflan donate gold to Tymora's temple. Fitz and Kriptek talk to Hew and we all but Jack decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard. After praying to Tymora, Jack starts making his way back. On his way back he happens to stp in a puddle and soaks his boot.</p>
