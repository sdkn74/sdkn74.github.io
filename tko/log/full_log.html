										<h1>2024-06-26 (The Beginning)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>We start off the campaign with the basics of the campaign. Plaguing the land of Chult is the Death Curse. This curse causes all who die to die for good, no chance at revivify, no miracles, nothing. Our party was answering the call from  Syndra Silvane to stop the Soulmonger (a necromatic artifact) affecting Chult. We all land in Port Nyanzaru with a waterskin full of wine. The air is hot, humid, and rainy in the way a hot summer rain makes things worse and not cooler.</p>
									<p>We spend most of our time exploring the port town and taking in the sights and the town. As we explore we find out that to explore the island of Chult we'll need to find a guide and will most likely need to find a way down the river as that will be the fastest way to travel. As we learn about the guides we decide to go with Hew Hakinstone. He has no left arm and is looking for revenge against Tinder (a red dragon at Wyrmheart Mine). We had to talk to Jobal the guide "licenser" to get Hew. We agree to help him fight Tinder and then he can help us find the Soulmonger. During the town exploration we also discover the following places below.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>After getting a guide and hearing about the Dino races the next day we decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard for some drinks. We're talking to Ms. Man in the pub and she mentions that if we put a bet on the dino races for her she'll help us out afterwards. We then head to bed to get an early start to the next day.</p>

										<h1>2024-07-10 (Dino Races)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As we wake up after getting settled in we hear the town buzzing for the Dino Races. As we're going to go find a place to make wagers we're approached by a crazy guy yelling about snake men and how they are trying to revive the ancient god under the city. There are three races that we bet on.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>4 legged race (drag race style)</li>
										<li>2 legged race (drag race style)</li>
										<li>Unchained (any number of legs, attacks are allowed but they are rare)</li>

									</ol>


									<hr class="major" />

									<p>As the race ends and we're celebrating our friend's victory a barrel is thrown at us and does 9 damage to Fitz and Oflan. The one who threw it was a Yuan-ti (Snake-person) and the throw seems intentional. K'lahu (female chultan) saw what happened and asked if we were ok. During our talk with her she mentioned that there is a "low life" not paying their debt to her after the race. If we can help her collect we can get 10% of the 500gp if we help.</p>

									<p>We head out to find a gladiator chultan (Taban) and once we approach his place he starts giving us a hard time and he tries to intimidate us into backing away. We aren't intimidated and Jack goes into a rage to try to intimidate him, this causes Taban to throw K'lahu off the porch and we launch into a battle.</p>

									<p>After the battle we get 1 of the 10 precious gemstones worth 50gp. On our way back we're chatting with K'lahu and we hear <a href="/tko/rumors.html">a couple of rumors from her.</a></p>

									<p>It's now dusk so we go to see Ms. Man. She says that if we're still in town in 3 days we can get a discounted heatlh potion from her for the dino race bet we helped her out with. We then head to the Thundering Lizard and Fitz get's a crossbow. We then head to sleep.</p>

										<h1>2024-07-24 (Tymora)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>During breakfast Fitz gives Jack some Goggles of Night to give him Darkvision. While Fitz is showing off his cool new crossbow he shoots it into the ceiling and we all....calmly, definitely calmly, tell him to put it down. But the biggest news is that he made us all a bag of holding. Hew is hanging out with us during all of this and Fitz is asking him about the travel routes and the fact we're looking for the Soulmonger. While eating alarms start blaring and Hew throws down some coin and goes to see what the commotion is while we follow.</p>

									<p>We keep following the alarms and see that the Temple of Tymora (luck goddess) is under attack from a Ghoul, 5 Zombies, and 6 Skeletons who are trying to break down the door to the temple. We fight them off and during the fight Taban showed up to help out. After the battle we gather up 5 gallongs of Tej (fermented honey wine) and 2 health potions. Before leaving the temple Jack and Oflan donate gold to Tymora's temple. Fitz and Kriptek talk to Hew and we all but Jack decide to head back to the Thundering Lizard. After praying to Tymora, Jack starts making his way back. On his way back he happens to stp in a puddle and soaks his boot.</p>

										<h1>2024-08-21 (Unlucky foot of the West)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>After the fight at Tymora's Temple we were all back at the Thundering Lizard with Hew and Taban. We notice 2 people walk in, a female half-orc priest (Undril Silvertusk) and a male human (Volo) with a book under their arm. The priest is wearing a Torm medallion. Torm was a fallen soldier in the holy wars who became a God after death. We decide to invite them over and talk with them for a bit. Undril is trying to get some bags/supplies to Camp Vengeance, specifically for Commander Niles Breakbone. We mention that we're heading that way and we're happy to accompany her to the camp. While talking to Volo we buy his Monster Guide (50gp) with the intention of getting at least 3 new monsters documented for him in where he'll give us our money back.</p>

									<p>After resting up we go looking for a canoe to go down river and Hew mentions we need to talk to Ekene-Afa. On our way we hear another rumor that the Yuan-ti have a temple on the island and are looking to revive their god by sacrificing people of the island. As we reach Ekene-Afa we reserve a canoe to be picked up the next day at noon and look at the items she has for sale. Everything is pretty expensive but we do get a rain catcher to help us gather water on our journey. We head back for the day unlucky things keep happening to Jack and he names himself the "Unlucky foot of the West". That night we see a human male (Artus Cimber) and his Saurial companion (Dragonbait). They mention they were on their way to Orolunga but their Yuan-ti guide abandoned them. We learn from them that Camp Righteous is near Camp Vengeance and hear the history of the area. While talking with them both Jack notices that Artus has a ring that's always covered in frost and he also has tattoos that say "Byrt" and "Lugg". Jack asks about the ring and all that Artus will say is that it's from the jungle and that it was his wife's who had passed. We then wind down for the night in preparation of the next day.</p>

									<p>The next day after breakfast we decide to visit Tymora's temple again. Jack get's a medallion and doesn't stay for the service while Kriptek does. As Kriptek is at the serice Fitz does some tinkering tool stuff on the equipment from the ghoul fight while Oflan has a one person service for Zou and he finds 2 silver pieces afterwards. We head to se Ms. Man and get a discounted health potion and an extra one at normal price. We then head to get the canoe with Brighttusk and she talks more about the Soulmonger and how it siphons souls.There may be red wizards related to it but she's not sure if they're evil or not. They might be in ruins on the island South of River Soshenstar and West of Sky Lizard Mountains. We arrive where we're picking up the canoe and Ekene-Afa's sons Soshen and Tiryk are excited to meet Kriptek since he was the jockey that won the dino races on Nasty Boi.</p>

									<p>We get ready for the trip by dousing up on insect repellant and start heading down the river. We decide to book it for the first 10 miles in the rain. As we start to slow to rest a bit Kriptek notices a bank of blue mist. Hew says it's magic mist and will give you "Blue Mist Fever". Though magical the mist is not controlled by people and is natural phenomenon. We pull off to another bank and find an enbankment with an overhand and a wall to our backs. We then start our shifts for sleeping. On the first watch Oflan notices a flock of four Quetzalcoatluses flying overhead, they don't seem threatening so we let them fly past as we hunker down. We get our long rest and prepare for the next day.</p>

										<h1>2024-09-18 (Survival is harder than it looks)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Camp Vengeance is 4-6 days away and we need 2 gallons of water per day. The first day it starts pouring rain and we keep moving while it's raining. We see 4 swarms of Quipers (Piranha like creatures) and they aren't in Volo's book. To learn more about them Jack decides to try to fish one of them in by noodling his arm. He gets bitten by one fish for 15 points of damage and yanks his arm out of the water. We figure out the Quipers have hearty scales (resistant to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage) and they are immune to restrain, grapple, and stun conditions. After the damage is done Jack rips off the fish and tries to throw it past people's heads and smacks Hew in the head for 6 points of damage. Hew gets snippy with Jack for messing around and Oflan heals Jack for 6 points of healing to help with his wounds.</p>
										
									<p>The rest of the day went by pretty uneventfully and we find an embarkment as evening approaches. We set up camp, have some rations, and have a nice peaceful uneventful night. The next morning we forage for some food but find nothing. We get our water purified since the day doesn't look like rain and we prepare to set off.</p>
										
									<p>This time we head out at a faster pace to make up some time from going slower the day before. As we're traveling down the river we spot two dinos in the water and book it to shore. While we're waiting for them to leave Jack and Kriptek go scavenging for food/supplies. While out they find 2 giant boars and decide to pounce on one to get food. They take the boar down quickly and get 40ish rations from the boar. As they come back Fitz starts showing off the fishing pole he crafted. We're pushing back out into the river when Hew mentions how usually the right side bank is the safer side and we should stick to that side when getting off the river. Just as the afternoon trip down the river begins we see 6 Yuan-ti and decide to pick up the pace after remembering how wonderfully they treated us in Port Nyanzaru. They don't like us leaving and decide to pull out short bows and fire on us. Some of us get hit and we fire arrows and spells back at them. They try to charm us and almost get Hew but we get away before things go downhill too quickly. The rest of the day goes by smoothly and we stop to make camp for the day and get a long rest.</p>
										
									<p>The next day it looks like rain so we set up the rain catcher. About halfway through the day we see 2 zombie ogres on the banks to the left and we all paddle as quickly as we can to get out of range of them ASAP. The rest of the day was quiet, almost like the rain was keeping everything bunkered down. We don't find a great place to set up camp so we end up in a mostly open field. Besides not having cover we have a quiet night and get ready to travel the next morning. The weather is steady rain but nothing too strong where it would impact travel but that means it won't mask our sounds much either. About an hour into the day we see a big wooden box on the shore and as we get near Jack jumps out directly onto the short to grab the box. As he's back in we see there are 4 potions of healing in there and we split them up among the adventuring party. As we're heading off Hew points out tiny creatures in the bushes called Chwingas which are tiny elemental creatures/spirits. The rest of the day is smooth and we find a great alcove to shelter in for the night.</p>
										
									<p>The next day as we're on the river Zhent (humanoid) is on the shore with a flying snake pet. They're with a priest, 8 people who look suspiciously like thugs, and 2 tribal warriors. They try to get us to pull off the river but we're suspicious of the group. We paddle backwards a bit to slow our trip down the river to talk to them but don't get off the river. They mention they're looking for Artus and we mention that we only talked to him for a quick bit back in Port Nyanzaru. We gave him some of the info we knew but don't mention the ring of ice or anything like that, then we continue on down the river.</p>
										
									<p>We see Camp Righteous up ahead and see that it's abandoned but there is a temple. We dock at the camp and decide to expore the area. We notice the commander tents are empty, Jack sees a bird in a pen (fledgling Axebeak, flightless bird). While investigating the temple we notice it has a symbol to Thorm. While investigating the latrine area Jack finds a dead templar and helps bury them with their war hammer but takes the 5 gemstones (worth 10gp each). We decide we'll need to explore the temple or set up camp for the night next session</p>

										<h1>2024-10-02 (We've got a jug of alchemy)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>History of the temple: Early days of the world a Chultan wanted to cross the river but was scared. The crocodile asked the man why he was scared. The man said crocodiles scared him. The crocodile offered to carry the man across the river for a favor and the man reluctantly agreed. The favor the man had to return was to carry the crocodile across to the realm of man which took years. "We will never like crocodiles again" said the man.</p>

									<p>We start going into the temple and we barely make it in before Jack and Oflan fall into a trap. We notice the next one though and avoid it. We come up to a 7 foot wall and help each other over. As we approach the top we see notches in the walls to our left and right where blades look to come from (another trap). A few of us try to pass and Hew reminds us to remember the story of the Crocodile and we decided to put each other on our backs and walk across with no problems. We get to and over another 7 foot wall and make it to the 3rd floor. We have to look at a mirror image of our floor and check for which way to go. We do 4 checks and make it to the next ledge. We see a door with a 4x4 pattern (buttons within the pattern). We press 4-3-3-1 to match our checks across the ground. We see a glyph show up and get Thunderwave cast on us. We decide we need to press all the buttons at the same time with the two people on top of others hitting the top two row's  buttons and the two people on the bottom pressing the bottom 2 row's buttons. The door opens.</p>
										
									<p>We walk in to a 20 foot by 40 foot room with a central pillar. The pillar is 30 feet tall with a beautiful ceramic jug on top. Jack finds a really well preserved femur from a dinosaur next to the pillar (it was used as a club). The pillar has depictions of the man and the Crocodile along it's surface. Fitz casts detect magic and notices the jug is magical. Kriptek picks up the jug and we walk back down the stairs around the pillar. Kriptek drops the jug and Jack picks it up, the room starts to fall apart as we reach the bottom of the stairs. We all run out of the temple and meet back up with Hew. As we're showing off the new jug we hear an arrow thud nearby and find 8 goblins and a goblin chief to fight.</p>
										
									<p>Batiri Goblins attack us and after killing them we look at and inspect the jug more. We find out that it's an Alchemy Jug with 10 possible liquids. The liquid comes out at 2 gallons per minute up to the liquid max. No long rest as we're going to roll for night encounters.</p>

										<h1>2025-01-08 (Merek who?)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>As we're setting up camp Hew and Oflan took first watch. We heard a rustle in the bushes and a 6ft human fell into our camp. Hew and I wake the others and kinda grill him about who he is and why he's here of all places. He starts asking us questions back and we ask if he's heard of the Soulmonger. He mentions that he has and Orlongu might be a place to get more information. He mentions that he was kinda roped into trying to help while he was in port. We decide to test his mettle to see if we think he'll help out the squad instead of holding us back. Jack throws some rations in the air and Merek hits each piece with no problem. </p>
									<p>The second watch is Merek and Fitz, we decide that having someone we know on watch with the new guy makes the most sense. They chit chat and Fitz shows Merek the body of Kriptek (who we're trying to revive). As Merek and Fitz talk about crafty stuff a vine reaches from the shadows and tries to get Fitz's leg. As he avoids the vine Merek notices the vine as well and they then roll initiative for the fight. During the first round they yell out to wake up the rest of the party.After killing the vine the second watch finishes with the Steel Defender mended and Fitz getting healed.</p>
									<p>Third watch is Jack by himself and he smells the overwhelming stench of death and hears the shuffling of feet. He quietly wakes us all up and both myself and Merek notice 9 Ghouls and a Ghast. The Ghast is leading the ghouls and it has a blue triangle tattooed on it's forehead dictating that it served Ras Nsi (Ras Nsi was a chultan palidan and tried to conqure people with an undead army and was removed of his god given power). We fight off the undead and all collapse back into bed and somehow get a long rest.</p>

										<h1>2025-01-22 (A wicked witch, maybe?)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Oflan prays to their god to give out info on everything we are encountering so we can send this over to other people within our faith. We pack up after breakfast and we are moving up the mountain pass, we only have to go up 3 miles to get to the village. Jack and the metal defender help us less dexterous people with the rough terrain. As we're about 2 miles up the path we clear the treeline and Fitz and I see 3 different points of interest.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>South East - Heart of Ubtao (massive chunk of earth and rock hanging about 200 feet above the ground)</li>
										<li>West - Ziggarat (Pyramid) is at Orlongu</li>
									    <li>South - Wreck of the Star Goddess (shipwreck in the jungle, a wooden vessel in tree branches broken into 3 chunks)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>As we finish the final mile and approach the Ghost Village we notice that the entrance is littered with bleached bones of people. The only thing left standing past the entrance is a hut with thatch and leather over a giant dead reptile ribcage. Around the hut there is a shuffling human figure but they're moving in an almost animalistic manner. We assume this is the witch and we decide to approach (Oflan, Jack with Kriptek's body on his shoulder, and Fitz). We introduce ourselves and her face is so gaunt and old that she almost looks undead. While talking to the witch about the ceremony she says she needs us to perform a task and then gather the material ingredients for the ritual.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Kill the pterrafolk nest (south side, deal with it first)</li>
										<li>A lock of hair or some fingernails from Breakbone (not needed necessarily but definitely wanted)</li>
										<li>Need the corpse of the humanoid we're trying to revive</li>
										<li>A gemstone worth 100 gold or more</li>
										<li>A sacrifice of another live humanoid</li>
									</ul>
									<p>As we hear all this we decide to finally ask the witch's name and she say's it's "Nanny Pu'pu". Fitz asks how the ritual circumvents the death curse and she mentions that the person would be brought back to life. They wouldn't need food or water or sleep and they are not permanently brought back to life. She mentions that if we bring them back to life and solve the death curse this could be a permanent solution. The witch is asking for all of us to come to her so we can all get pointed in the right direction. We aren't sure exactly if we want to sacrifice someone so we decide to go after the pterrafolk and go from there. As we head to the south to find the nest we see a chute 70 feet back from the edge of the platue that goes down 30 feet. It's a tight squeeze but if you're a medium creature with light or no armor you can fit. Fitz uses the rope of climbing to anchor it and set 1ft knots to give advantage going back up. We decend and we find ourselves in a triangle cavern with a 30ft wide mouth out the side of the platue and goes back 60ft to the chute we are decending. We find 9 pterrafolk who are wanting to fight.</p>
									<p>After the fight we still need to investigate the cavern</p>

										<h1>2025-02-05 (No, it's mayonnaise)</h1>
									</header>

									<p>While investigating the cavern after the pterrafolk we come across some bodies by the chute. The bodies look like other adventurers and in their backpacks we find 20gp, a silvered dagger, and a potion of greater healing. Besides the bodies there doesn't seem to be anything else there so we decide to head back to Nanny Pu'Pu to tell her the job is done. As we finsish the climb back up the chute we see across the way that Nanny is dragging something by her hut entrance. We don't see anyone else standing around and then Oflan asks where Hew went. Realizing what must have happened we rush over and see Hew dead on the ground. Nanny Pu'Pu says that more pterrafolk showed up and attacked them but as we looked at Hew we noticed the claw marks don't line up with the ones on us after the battle. We keep pressing for answers while very unsubtly asking questions that indicate we think she did it. She then announces that we should have just let things go and turns invisble. ROLL INITIATIVE.</p>

									<p>After defeating Nanny Pu'Pu, her flesh golem, and the flying monkeys running away we investigate the hut. We're looking to see if she had written anything down about healing and/or reviving people but her hut was pretty empty. We deduced that she was probably the one killing and eating the people in the village and that the pterrafolk were a threat to further food sources for her. We also notice that she had some items to indicate that she was a worshiper of the Lord of Bones (Myrkel). Fitz decided to cast detect magic and found the Cistern in the middle of the village had something magical in it. The water at the bottom was scummy and black as night. Jack was willing to go down into the depths to find the magical item and we held on to the rope of climbing as he decended. As he approached the water he tested it by splashing it with his hand (learning his lesson from the fish in the river) and nothing happened. He determined that he could enter safely and held his breath while he went down 20ft into a small cavern at the bottom. He grabbed a bag and when he had it in his hands he yanked on the rope to have us pull him up. Since he wasn't out of the cavern he smacked his head against the top of the cavern as we yanked him up. As we help him up he shows us the sack made of human skin and we find the following inside.</p>
