									<p>We start in the early afternoon after fighting the Grungs. Jack shows the map he got off the body of one of the Grungs to us and Fitz realizes the marked red "X" is about 5 to 10 miles Southwest. We decide to see if there are any treasure (as one would do with a map marked like this). We end up around a Grung village of sorts with six huts and we start looking through every hut for any treasure. Jack finds two hooded lanterns and ten flasks of oil. Fitz finds three casks of Tej. Steve finds a set of navigator's tools and Yormash finds cartographer's tools and ten rations which he shares. Artus finds four quivers of 14 arrows each. We almost make it back to the ambush area with the Grungs and find a good place to rest.</p>
									
									<p>First watch went by uneventful. Second watch was also, surprisingly, uneventful. Third watch, a giant constrictor snake goes after Dragonbait. After the battle, Jack gets 12 rations from the body.</p> 
									
									<p>As we wake, we hear thunder and smell rain. We use the Alchemy Jug to create water. We have smooth sailing through the jungle and break for lunch. Fitz starts the fire without one of Jack's oil flasks. Jack seemed disgruntled giving it up. As the fire starts, Steve casts fire bolt after the fire has already been started as Fitz dives out of the way. They have a conversation where Steve feels proud for making the fire and Fitz wearily congratulates him on a job well done. The smoke seems very enticing, but thankfully the rain seems to prevent the smell from carrying far and the smell doesn't attract any dangers. As we continue on, we hear someone tell us to stop. A guy in a red robe with six guards and four skeletons looks over the party. He's the guy from earlier who was looking for Artus and his ring. Before we have a chance to try to talk things out he starts to attack us. We dispatch those enemies and Artus tells us about the people after him again. Artus shows off other abilities of his ring and makes an ice sculpture of Jack, three feet tall. While we were all pretty impressed it then starts hopping around. As dusk is approaching we decide to get a bit away from the battle area and Steve finds a great spot to set up camp. All watches uneventful.</p>
