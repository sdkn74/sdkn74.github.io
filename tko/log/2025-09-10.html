									<p>After the fight with the Zorbos we get a long rest in and we wake up to thunderous storms. We still use the Alchemy Jug for water to ensure we have pure drinking water. Steve (now played by his actual person) apologizes to Artus and Dragonbait for the fireball that was cast on all three of them. Steve starts to smell violets from Dragonbait but doesn't know what that means. Jack and Fitz try to scope out the path ahead by getting up a muddy hill and getting above the treeline. They realize just how strong the rain is as they don't see much. Looking back we see trails where Steve and Artus slid back down the muddy hill and Yormash flies down to help push/pull them both up the hill. As we crest the hill we decide to slide down the other side to continue on our path. At the bottom of the hill we try to listen for any possible threats but thankfully there are none. We finish the day pretty uneventfully and find a nice outcropping to make camp. 1st watch Yormash, Artus, and Dragonbait are keeping watch. Dragonbait smells like honeysuckle (tenderness or concern) and we all notice a group of Goblins coming from the East. We all quickly handle the situation and go to bed. 2nd watch Jack and Steve notice 4 Yuan-ti who purposefully avoid our camp and head towards the Wreck of the Star Goddess (our destination). 3rd watch was uneventful.</p>

									<p>The next day the rest of us are told about the Yuan-ti from Steve and Jack. The weather isn't stormy but there is still a heavy rain. We use the Jug to make water again. Jack and Artus keep talking while walking and they just keep walking into branches. Fitz, Yormash, and Steve keep noticing movement in our peripheral vision but don't see anything when we look at the areas directly. Around lunch we get to the ship and hear a voice calling out while a head pokes over the side of the ship looking down on us. Thasselandra Bravewing introduces herself as the captain of the Star Goddess and they'd wrecked the ship a couple weeks back. She sounds weak describing the attack on the ship from Pterrafolk and how they heard their scouting party's screams when they initially tried to leave the wreck. We all make it up to the first level of the wreck and Thasselandra introduces us to Ra-das the Navigator and Faix Haranis the Master-of-Arms. We give them water and rations and try to comfort them and encourage them to eat and drink, but slowly so their bodies don't reject it all. Artus, Jack, and Dragonbait decide to head to the second piece/level of the wreck to help the others when 4 Girallon Zombies (4 armed Gorilla Zombies) attack. </p>

									<p>After the battle Yormash helps the remaining guard on the second level with Steve as the guard was in shock from almost dying. Steve gets him to east some stuff while reassuring him. Jack goes up to the final piece/level of the wreck and searches for stuff. He opens a chest and sees a potion of healing. He doesn't take it, but goes out to ask about the chest and potion from Thasselandra. She says that the chest is a magic chest that will show each of us what we need one time, and if the chest closes without the item being taken it will not appear again. Jack quickly goes back to the chest he left open but it seems to have shut itself. Fitz finds a Potion of Firebreath, Steve gets a Wand of Magic Missle, Yormash opens the chest to a Guardian Emblem, and Artus finds a Potion of Hill Giant Strength.</p>
