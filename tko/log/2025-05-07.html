									<p>As we leave the mine it's around lunchtime. Kanye (Kobold) reminds us about the Pirates in Jahaka Bay. Since we're so close to the bay we decided to get some greenery and Fitz made camouflage for the canoe (+5 to stealth checks). Merek decided to go hunting to get us some food for the long journey ahead and manages to nab a boar. Jack and Kanye decide to go fishing as well but both of them end up with nothing. Merek comes back with the boar and cooks it up and we get about 15lbs of meat.</p>
									
									<p>We get onto the canoe and since the pirates were patrolling the bay we decided to stay along the coastline. To help with us sneaking we used the cover of dark to by the pirates. We make it past the Kobold Mountains by daybreak. Oflan, Fitz, and Merek go for a nap as they were up all night. The weather is heavier rain and we made wine with the Alchemy Jug. by nightfall we get to the edge of Shilku Bay. We all pull the canoe over and rest for the night.</p>

									<p>First watch Oflan and Kanye talk about a lot of stuff and the watch was uneventful. Second watch was also uneventful and the third watch was they clocked 5 winged beasts (Pterradons) but they stay above the water. The next morning we used the Alchemy Jug for wine again and the weather is a full on storm. We decide to go inland and hide the canoe and maybe we can come back to it later. We do a decent job hiding the canoe and then start trekking towards the mine. Oflan, Kanye, and Merek end up falling down a steep hill. We finally make it to the clearing right in front of the mine. We make camp and prepare for the watches and Fitz ritual casts "Alarm".</p>

									<p>First watch Oflan and Kanye end up talking. Oflan finds a good bushel of island weed and Kanye and him smoke it. Shenanagins ensue and Oflan makes the fish sticks joke. Kanye totally get it and he spends most of the rest of the shift trying to explain it. When the shift is over Oflan and Kanye try to hide the rest of their stash under the ground and Oflan tries to wake up robo-buddy instead of Fitz because he's so out of it. Second watch Merek and Fitz see the drawings of fish, giant dicks, and odd rectangles. They smell the weed and eventually find Oflan and Kanye's stash. Fitz digs it up and hides it from us (what a punk). Third watch for Jack and robo-buddy was pretty uneventful.</p>

									<p>The next day the weather is light rain and the Alchemy Jug creates wine (shocker). As we wake up Fitz and Merek approach Kanye and Oflan about the weed. Then Kanye gets gifted a pipe from Jack, smokes a bit out of it, and uses the smoke to somehow capture a wasp nest. He also get's a sling for throwing stuff. We came up with a name for our group called "Special K and the Revengers". We approach the mine and notice 2 buildings on either side of the entrance. On the right was a larger building and the left was a smaller building. We decide to investigate the left building and it looks like an overgrown office with nothing inside. The second building on the right and Jack pries open the door and we find some supplies for mine workers. We took a few items and enter the mine.</p>

									<p>As we enter the mine we find a mine cart and decide to wait until we find more before riding them down the tracks. We find a bridge and decide to cross, as we look down we don't see anyone or any other mine carts. As we are approaching the other side we hear echoes of voices across the bridge. Jack crosses stealthily and gets close enough to hear the conversation but doesn't understand it. He knew there were 2 voices and the ended up hearing up sneaking up on them and we attack. After the battle we have 30 brown eggs (Kobold eggs). We talked to Kanye about fighting other Kobolds and what we should do with the eggs. We stopped in 6B (for DM).</p>
