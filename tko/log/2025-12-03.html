									<p>We started off battling the four golems holding bronze spears. We took them down without major injuries and after we finished the battle we went upstairs with the spears. We checked to make sure the spears don't have any symbols that need to be matched up to the statues on the floor above. We tried to time the spear entry to be the same time, but Steve is off by a half second. The pedestal twists open and a 3 inch puzzle cube appears on the pedestal. The images on the sides are all the same, jaguars with snakes. Steve ritually casts detect magic while Fitz fixes his robo-buddy. Steve get's back that Abjuration magic is emitting from the cube. Steve uses mage hand to pick it up and Fitz checks the pedestal for more info, but he finds nothing. We remember the phrase from the wall before "The puzzle cubes are the key".</p>
									
									<p>We take the cube and leave the shrine while Jack goes ahead again to check for enemies. He doesn't see anything in the buildings, so Yormash looks in. Yormash sees the ground looks cracked and unstable so Jack finds some rocks and smashes the ground. Yormash throws a nut! light in the hole and Jack tries to tie a rope on a tree to repel down. Tymora must not have been with Jack as when he's heading into the hole the knot unties and he falls into the hole. Unfortunately for him there's nothing down there. Jack grabs the nut! light and Yormash pulls him up but Jack slips and gets scraped up as he has pulled up from the hole. Jack lets Steve investigate the next building and he sees it's dirty and dusty. There's a table with a pouch on it and something inside. He mage hands it and opens it and sees a statue of Shagambi, 2 painted potteries, and 3 Jade Rings. Jack goes into the next courtyard and sees a smoldering wreckage with dogs eating corpses. We go back to the shrine after foraging and finding nothing, and notice five Yuan-ti coming right for us. They all look a little bit different than the ones that attacked us in Port Nyanzaru.</p>
