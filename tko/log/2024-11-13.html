									<p>First shift of the first night was uneventful. The second shift Kriptek wakes up and drew Fitz while he slept, after he finished he put the well drawn parchment away but Jack noticed this out of the corner of his eye. The third shift Fitz ans Silvertusk notice a being lurking at the end of the night but never approached. In the morning Kriptek, Hew, and Silvertusk pack up camp while Fitz, Jack, and Oflan go look for clues about the creature. We find fur, almost like a Tabaxi's and Oflan tries to look for the creature by shaking a branch yelling "PISS PISS PISS" (nat 1 on the roll) while beating the branch around the thick grass.</p>

									<p>We set the Alchemy Jug to create a vial of poison (2 uses per vial). We then push off into the river. The morning is uneventful but in the afternoon we see at the banks of the near shore is a party of 5 fighting undead. Just as we're coming in to help them they finish off the last undead and Fitz notices they're with the Emerald Enclave. We talk to them for a bit with Father of Mielikki and his 4 scouts (Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde).</p>

									<p>Rumor: Aldani Basin -> The river ends in a marshy swamp. The Aldani are lobster folk, and if you stay out of their home they'll leave you alone. This basin does connect to the river Tath.</p>

									<p>We break for lunch, enjoy a nice relaxing time, and then keep going down the river, it looks like storms again. Staying towards the right side of the river we stop to make camp. Jack catches 4 fish and we have fish and chips for dinner. Hew and I notice 10 Terradons and they're flying lower towards us. We don't know their intentions so Hew grabs a torch and scares them as they're descending. We trade off shifts so Fitz and Kriptek can take watch. As they're watching 4 crocodiles come out and attack Kriptek. We fight them all off successfully and Jack skins the crocodiles to make boots later.</p>

									<p>Hew tells us we have about a full day of travel until we get to Camp Vengeance. It looks to be a sunny day and we use the Alchemy Jug to make poison again. We take it easy down the river and realize we probably don't want to approach the camp at night so we go to set up our own camp about a mile away. As we're approaching the bank we see a giant troll running down towards us. We beat and burn the troll and realize that acid is also a way to prevent the troll from healing itself. We look for anything interesting on the troll and find 50gp and while pulling up the loincloth Jack sees a big ol' troll penis. Hew looks at the boat and thinks it's find but Fitz goes about casting Mending on it just in case and fixes any issues we may not have seen. We go through the rest of the night peacefully and are ready to head to Camp Vengeance the next day.</p>
