									<p>After last session's fight, we keep going to try to get out of the danger zone but we're so tired that we don't notice 12 skeletons and they ambush us. During the fight, Dragonbait smells like lemon (he was doing well during the fight). We quickly dispatch all the skeletons and keep moving forward and thankfully don't run into any more enemies before sunset. We try to find a good place to camp, but don't find anything that looks particularly safe or hidden from being out in the open. We are so tired, we decide to just set up camp anyway. Since we are outside the dangerous area we are very hopeful that we can have a nice quiet night of rest (surely saying that won't backfire).</p>

									<p>Artus and Dragonbait take the first watch. Artus is lost in thought for most of his watch but thankfully it's uneventful. Yormash and Fitz take the second watch. During the watch Yormash reminisces about Kanye Fitz pulls out a joint to honor him. Yormash and Fitz get stoned and don't notice anything through their watch but it is also thankfully uneventful. Yormash then tries to whisper loudly to wake up Jack but not anyone else. He then just puts a half smoked joint in Jack's hand and heads to bed. Jack just drops the joint as he doesn't smoke. Steve and Jack then prepare for the third watch. They notice that the jungle sounds are off, but nothing comes crawling out of the jungle so they have an uneventful watch as well.</p>

									<p>The next day, the weather is sunny and we use the Alchemy Jug to make water. Jack notices a group of Grungs consisting of 10 grunts Grungs and one elite Grung that ambush us. After killing them, we investigate the bodies and we realize that the skin of the Grungs excrete poison. Fitz and Yormash fail to extract any of the Grung's poison on their own. We all then decide to try to work together on the final purple Grung and Artus extracts 2 vials of poison. The effects of the poison are the normal poison condition and after 1 minute if the target is still poisoned they feel a desperate need to cover themselves in mud or liquid. They will take all their movement to do so. While searching other bodies Jack found a rough map with a red X on it. He tried to determine where around himself the map could be referencing but is easily confused (poor guy got a Natural 1).</p>
