									<p>As we leave the room it's dawn of the next day even though we entered in the afternoon and ere only there for about an hour. The weather is rainy and we still use the Alchemy Jug to make water since we don't have a rain catcher. Talking with Artus, he mentions the Red Wizards are against him. He says that trouble follows him around it's it's because of those wizards. We easily get back down the ziggurat with no issues as there aren't anything on the steps anymore. Yormash realizes that there is no canoe in the ears so we're going to have to walk the river. We head east to find the river and Artus mentions that we should cross at the elevation of the Wreck of the Star Goddess so that we don't go down to have to climb back up. We agree and have a productive start to the day and decide to short rest at lunch. Fitz asks about Dragonbait and they indicate that they would prefer not to be in Volo's guile. After the short rest we head back out and get to the river right as dusk is approaching. Artus and yormash find a good sleeping spot and set up camp. Steve notices Dragonbait is checking him out a bit more than usual.</p>

									<p>The first watch goes by pretty uneventfully as is the second (though Jack for some reason is trying very hard to see in the dark). Fitz and Robo buddy take the third watch and see 4 Quetzalcoatluses (fun fact, we only saw them one other time and it was about 1 year ago IRL) but they pass on by without causing any issues. The next morning it's still raining and we make water with the Alchemy Jug again. We approach the thinnest width of the river and see it's about 20 feet across and 10 feet deep. Jack decides to get on Bob and tries to float across the river with a rope tied to him. He ends up 5 feet down the river but across. We tie a rope off and Artus and Dragonbait start to go across. Artus loses his grip and Dragonbait barely catches him to bring him back. The Quippers attack Artus though and after being attacked he yells out. His ring starts to glow and he casts a Cone of Cold on the Quippers and freezes all of them but none of them die. Dragonbait then slashes at the swam and manages to kill them all. Yormash finds a log (nat 20) and him and Steve make it across using the log as a makeshift raft. Yormash tries to throw the log back across the river and it impales itself into the bottom of the river (nat 1). Robo buddy make it easy and then Yormash smacks his head as he remembers that he as wings. We still for some reason decide to have Fitz tie the rope to himself as he gets a running start and we all yank on the rope as he tries to jump the river. He makes it 3/4 of the way and then belly flops as we drag him the rest of the way to safety.</p>

									<p>After the river crossing we decide to head south (where the spiders were the first time we passed by). Fitz and Jack get distracted and Yormash ends up looking for the giant spiders only to find their old webs. He points this out and Fitz and Jack realize this is close to the spot we need to cross. Artus tells us about his ring and opens up to us about it's powers and ends up freezing 120 feet radius out from his position. This ends up freezing the river and the ground. We quickly cross and then he drops the spell. He mentions that maybe the Frost Giants are after him too. We make it to the middle of the woods south of the river before nightfall. we find an alright spot for camp, it's not well hidden but it's not bad. We're around the Wukka trees grove and Artus tells us the nuts are good for being used as lights. You just have to shake the nut and it's bright for 10 feet and dim for 10 feet past that. If the nut breaks it's not going to shine, we all decide to take some.</p>

									<p>As we wind down for the night on the first watch Steve hears rusting. Artus and Dragonbait throw a couple of those nuts in the air and we see a group of Zorbos. We end up fighting them and Steve (played by Josh for the night) decides to cast Fireball on himself to get all the Zorbos and ends up getting Artus and Dragonbait as well. After the fight Fitz and Jack notice that the Zorbos are able to steal AC from objects and put it on themselves permanently. Also their AC is dependant on the materials around them.</p>
