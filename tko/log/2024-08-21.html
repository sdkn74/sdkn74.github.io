									<p>After the fight at Tymora's Temple we were all back at the Thundering Lizard with Hew and Taban. We notice 2 people walk in, a female half-orc priest (Undril Silvertusk) and a male human (Volo) with a book under their arm. The priest is wearing a Torm medallion. Torm was a fallen soldier in the holy wars who became a God after death. We decide to invite them over and talk with them for a bit. Undril is trying to get some bags/supplies to Camp Vengeance, specifically for Commander Niles Breakbone. We mention that we're heading that way and we're happy to accompany her to the camp. While talking to Volo we buy his Monster Guide (50gp) with the intention of getting at least 3 new monsters documented for him in where he'll give us our money back.</p>

									<p>After resting up we go looking for a canoe to go down river and Hew mentions we need to talk to Ekene-Afa. On our way we hear another rumor that the Yuan-ti have a temple on the island and are looking to revive their god by sacrificing people of the island. As we reach Ekene-Afa we reserve a canoe to be picked up the next day at noon and look at the items she has for sale. Everything is pretty expensive but we do get a rain catcher to help us gather water on our journey. We head back for the day unlucky things keep happening to Jack and he names himself the "Unlucky foot of the West". That night we see a human male (Artus Cimber) and his Saurial companion (Dragonbait). They mention they were on their way to Orolunga but their Yuan-ti guide abandoned them. We learn from them that Camp Righteous is near Camp Vengeance and hear the history of the area. While talking with them both Jack notices that Artus has a ring that's always covered in frost and he also has tattoos that say "Byrt" and "Lugg". Jack asks about the ring and all that Artus will say is that it's from the jungle and that it was his wife's who had passed. We then wind down for the night in preparation of the next day.</p>

									<p>The next day after breakfast we decide to visit Tymora's temple again. Jack get's a medallion and doesn't stay for the service while Kriptek does. As Kriptek is at the serice Fitz does some tinkering tool stuff on the equipment from the ghoul fight while Oflan has a one person service for Zou and he finds 2 silver pieces afterwards. We head to se Ms. Man and get a discounted health potion and an extra one at normal price. We then head to get the canoe with Brighttusk and she talks more about the Soulmonger and how it siphons souls.There may be red wizards related to it but she's not sure if they're evil or not. They might be in ruins on the island South of River Soshenstar and West of Sky Lizard Mountains. We arrive where we're picking up the canoe and Ekene-Afa's sons Soshen and Tiryk are excited to meet Kriptek since he was the jockey that won the dino races on Nasty Boi.</p>

									<p>We get ready for the trip by dousing up on insect repellant and start heading down the river. We decide to book it for the first 10 miles in the rain. As we start to slow to rest a bit Kriptek notices a bank of blue mist. Hew says it's magic mist and will give you "Blue Mist Fever". Though magical the mist is not controlled by people and is natural phenomenon. We pull off to another bank and find an enbankment with an overhand and a wall to our backs. We then start our shifts for sleeping. On the first watch Oflan notices a flock of four Quetzalcoatluses flying overhead, they don't seem threatening so we let them fly past as we hunker down. We get our long rest and prepare for the next day.</p>
