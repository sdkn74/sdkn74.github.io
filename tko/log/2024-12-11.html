									<p>We start the dreary morning by digging a grave for our companion Kriptek. As we're about halfway through a group of Chultan warriors from camp come out to help. As they're helping one of them mentions that there is a witch that can "bring him back". We press for more information but he mentions that this is only just a rumor but if we're interested we can to the ghost town on top of the plateau (Mbola) and we have to get him there within a week. We are a bit skeptical with the Death Curse affecting the island but we decide we're willing to give anything a try and head off to find Hew and let him know. We decide that since this is off the river we'll stash our boat and make the rest of the trek on foot.</p>

									<p>As we're about to leave we have the Alchemy Jug create more acid and Oflan tries to find the person giving out "go go bean juice". Oflan finds a halfling named Big Ben who is willing to sell some to Oflan for the road trip. As he brings some back he finds the quality lacking and realizes he overpaid for junk juice. We load up Kriptek's dead body into the boat and wrap it up in cloth to prevent freaking people out. Naturally today is a day of heavy rain and storms.</p>

									<p>While we're heading down the river we notice that it's difficult to see anything on the banks of the river. Hew somehow finds a great little cove for the night before we get to the Aldani Basin though. Since all the wood is wet we aren't able to create a fire and rely on rations for dinner. For the first watch Oflan works on sharpening his Yklwa again (though he almost never uses it) with help from Hew. We hear a giant shuffling sound and see a giant snapping turtle as it gets closer. As we're fighting the turtle Jack has a psychotic break (according to this author) and is convinced that Hew and Oflan are the reason the turtle is attacking and that it did nothing wrong. Jack ensures that he does a non-lethal strike on the turtle and when it wakes up he tries to feed it a bunch of fish we caught. SOMEHOW THIS RABBIT IS BLESSED BY TYMORA HERSELF AND ROLLS A NAT 20 ON FEEDING IT AND HAVING IT LEAVE.</p>

									<p>During the 3rd watch Fitz sees torch light approaching us, he wakes us up to prepare for what may come. We talk to the group that approaches us and they say they're a group hunting Ghouls and monsters. We talk for a bit and they mention something about undead and a fire newt. We wish them well on their search and don't offer them up a place at our camp and they head out. Later in the watch Fitz hears a bipedal creature with a rider following the previous hunters but since we don't have a fire he keeps quiet and let's the two pass.</p>

									<p>The next morning we use the Alchemy Jug to make Mayo because why not. Hew puts some in the go go bean juice and we all try the awful concoction. With a few options we decide to stash the canoe right now and start heading to the plateau on foot. Fitz's steel defender is carrying Kriptek while the weather is drizzling. We decide to stay at a normal pace to ensure we don't get lost and day 1 was some good progress with no issues. We create a small fire for the night and all 3 watches are uneventful. The next morning it looks like a cloudless day so we use the Alchemy Jug to create water for ourselves. Again the day was uneventful. The first watch of that night we see 7 adult and 2 young Hadrosauruses, they are largely peaceful and wander off. The rest of the watches are uneventful. For the 3rd day we use the jug for water again, Oflan prays to Zou to explain what has happened and check in. He feels a sense of calm, though he's not sure if it's from being answered or if he's just hoping he's been heard.</p>

									<p>As we approach the plateau Oflan rolls a nat 20 on perception and sees a possible encounter approaching. We see 3 Eblis (bird like creatures that speak common). We talk for a bit and they seem to know information about the plateau. We go back and forth a bit and they are adamant about getting 50gp for information about the town and plateau. Eventually Oflan pays up and we hear that the witch doesn't have a known name, people go up but never come down, and Pterrafolk don't like the village. Since we paid we have advantage on Pterrafolk checks. We decide to have camp at the base of the plateau.</p>
