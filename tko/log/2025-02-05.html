									<p>While investigating the cavern after the pterrafolk we come across some bodies by the chute. The bodies look like other adventurers and in their backpacks we find 20gp, a silvered dagger, and a potion of greater healing. Besides the bodies there doesn't seem to be anything else there so we decide to head back to Nanny Pu'Pu to tell her the job is done. As we finsish the climb back up the chute we see across the way that Nanny is dragging something by her hut entrance. We don't see anyone else standing around and then Oflan asks where Hew went. Realizing what must have happened we rush over and see Hew dead on the ground. Nanny Pu'Pu says that more pterrafolk showed up and attacked them but as we looked at Hew we noticed the claw marks don't line up with the ones on us after the battle. We keep pressing for answers while very unsubtly asking questions that indicate we think she did it. She then announces that we should have just let things go and turns invisble. ROLL INITIATIVE.</p>

									<p>After defeating Nanny Pu'Pu, her flesh golem, and the flying monkeys running away we investigate the hut. We're looking to see if she had written anything down about healing and/or reviving people but her hut was pretty empty. We deduced that she was probably the one killing and eating the people in the village and that the pterrafolk were a threat to further food sources for her. We also notice that she had some items to indicate that she was a worshiper of the Lord of Bones (Myrkel). Fitz decided to cast detect magic and found the Cistern in the middle of the village had something magical in it. The water at the bottom was scummy and black as night. Jack was willing to go down into the depths to find the magical item and we held on to the rope of climbing as he decended. As he approached the water he tested it by splashing it with his hand (learning his lesson from the fish in the river) and nothing happened. He determined that he could enter safely and held his breath while he went down 20ft into a small cavern at the bottom. He grabbed a bag and when he had it in his hands he yanked on the rope to have us pull him up. Since he wasn't out of the cavern he smacked his head against the top of the cavern as we yanked him up. As we help him up he shows us the sack made of human skin and we find the following inside.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>6 Onyx gemstones (50gp each)</li>
										<li>Spell scroll of comprehend languages</li>
										<li>10 Adamantium ingots (10gp each) that are stamped with runes from a Dwarven house/family</li>
									</ul>
									<p>After all this we go to bury Hew and collect from his body 50gp. We dig the grave and lay him down with his axe across his body, as he died fighting and deserves his weapon in the afterlife.</p>
