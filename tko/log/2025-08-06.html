									<p>As we are running back to Special K we hear balls ringing and realize the pirates know we were there. Steve tries to wash his ass and cleans off the shit. We follow Special K to his mine and decide to take a long rest here. Yormash short rests while camp is getting set up, Fitz identifies the scrolls (2nd level Scroll of Knock and 3rd level Scroll of Leomund's Tiny Hut), amulet (Amulet of Health), and cloak (Cape of Mountebank). We long rest easily within the mine. The next day we attune to the items. We make water with Alchemy Jug. Kange decides that things are getting a bit too hectic within our party seeing as he saw two of his friends die and realizes that his life debt to Oflan is technically paid. He decides he is going to stay with  with Sting (the captured Skunk) and Stinky (the captured Scorpion). After saying our goodbyes we go through the woods and follow the mountains to our left, heading back to Orolunga. About midday Jack perceives 6 swarms of centipedes.</p>
									
									<p>We easily kill the bugs and put out any fires that were started during the battle. We keep moving and by dinner time we're about 50% of the way to Orolunga. Up ahead we see a Chultan priest wearing the crest of Ubato (Maze on a disk). He tells us to stop and not come any closer. He tells us it's unsafe and he's there keeping people safe. As we're leaving Yormash asks his name and when he doesn't give it he calls out "See ya later Gouda". As we're finding a place about 300 feet away from the priest we decide to cast the tiny hut scroll to be safe during the long rest.</p>
									
									<p>We create water again with the Alchemy Jug and Fitz's keen mind gets us going in the right direction and to Orolunga by midday. lugor water Firis keen mind gets us going north, orlunga by mid day. We find the Ziggurat standing tall at 60 feet high with 3 levels. Steve casts detect magic and the whole ziggurat lights up in front of him. Jack tries to run up the stairs and no matter how much he tries he cannot move past the first foot. As we look around to get a hint Jack sees a Chwinga who dons a Triceretops mask and picks up an orange and purple orchid and easily runs up the stairs. We look around and find a field of those flowers and all pick one, then run up to the first level. As we arrive we see another Chwinga don a chameleon mask and holds the flower and a parrot feather to run up the next set of stairs. We find some feathers on the first floor landing and follow suit to the second level. As we get to the next level we see a bunch of snakes all over the stairs. Jack tries to run through them and takes some damage and comes back quickly. We see a third Chwinga don a mongoose mask, smack a snake in the head, tickles the snake's butthole with the feather, then let's the snake into it's mouth. The Chwinga then get's on it's stomach and slithers up the whole set of stairs. We all reluctantly do the same and get to the top where we see an entrance to a barren room.</p>

									<p>	At the top Yormash is trying to find the Naga and doesn't see it. We then enter the barren room still holding the flower and feather and suddenly the room comes to life like it was hundreds of years ago. An iridescent snake 5 feet tall rises up with a human face. They say "I am Sajan'baza" and asks us to speak our hearts desire. Jack and Fitz notice in the room that Dragonbait and Artus Cinder are also there. We mention that we are on our way to stop the death curse and the Soulmonger. The Naga says that the Soulmonger is Ras Nsi and urges us to kill them on sight. Yormash kneels and promises to kill them as soon as he can and receives a charm/blessing (can cast 3rd level conjure animals 3 times ever). The rest of the party follow suit and receive the following: Jack (Charm of Vitality, no exhaustion/immune to poison/max HP when using hit die to restore health 1 time use), Fitz (Charm of Restoration, 6 charges and can cast Greater Restoration with 4 charges or Lesser Restoration with 2 charges), Steve (Charm of Heroism, follow spell's wording).</p>

									<p>Before we leave we ask about the Chultan priest and we find out they're a wereboar. We then question the Naga about the heart of Ubato and find out an Elven Lich is there named Valindra Shadowmantle who is neutrally evil and also hung out with Szass Tam (the red powerful wizard). We then ask about the Wreck of the Star Goddess and find out it was a more recent accident but still have many undead around it. We also get told that to find the Soulmonger we should be in the air looking for a sunken area. As all of our questions are answered we leave and Artus and Dragonbait come along with us. Fitz decides to write about Dragonbait in Volo's book as we head out as well. </p>
