									<p>Finished long rest at canoe. Found the canoe and everything looks good. We bring it to the basin (stagnet water) and we determine where we need to go to get to the main branch of the river. We get to the river and it's storming. We have to row to move. I notice/hear something familiar and I hear a troll running at us from the shore, we row to the shore at 45Â° angle to make a stand. We take it down but can't kill it without fire or acid. We push it's decapitated head into the bottom of the river with a rock on top of it. We find camp and determine sleep order. A Oflan sleeps he sees Syndra Silvane in trouble and slowly dying. Oflan prays to his god to try to pray to help her. Oflan asks his friends to help out in the dream as well but only Fitz's robot looks to help. As he does so his eyes turn red and Oflan hears a giant boom and crack and wakes with a start. Oflan looks at the robot buddy to make sure things were just a dream and the robot buddy seems to be hanging out like normal. Oflan goes back to sleep and doesn't dream again.</p>

									<p>The next day we notice that the river is somehow going up in altitude, not super noticeable but over a long stretch of river we are gathering elevation. Jack finds a good camp though it's an older camp that was used in the past. During the 3rd shift we have to deal with crocodiles again. We gather water and food in the morning the next day and set off again. During our travels for the day we see a giant rotting frog with a short sword coming out through it's back. We pull off to investigate and find a dead halfling in the frog's mouth. We take the supplies from the halfling and find the following.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Potion of Hill Giant Strength</li>
										<li>Magical +1 Short Sword</li>
