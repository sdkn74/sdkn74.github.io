									<p>After defeating the Froghemoth, we notice there are rope bridges across the water. Before stepping on them we see that the bridges are weak, but Yormash notices a toppled monolith that creates sort of a stone bridge. Jack hops across the monolith and gets to the other side. As Jack is looking around, he sees a stone key inside the mouth of a frog statue. He grabs the key and then jumps back and we head to the front of the temple. We see a locked gate with an inscription in old Omuan. Orvex reads, "Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take." We use the key to open the gate and head inside. We see a bunch of sharpened spikes along the ground and around the perimeter of the room, at about every four feet, there is a wooden plank jutting from the wall. Twenty feet across this pit is the puzzle cube in an alcove on a pedestal. As we look down into the pit we see two bodies wearing Red Robes. We decide that Jack will head to the puzzle cube while we wait just inside the gate in case something happens. Jack decides to jump around the right side of the perimeter and every plank he jumps off of disappears. He picks up the puzzle cube off the pedestal and it depresses a bit into the ground. Jack tries to quickly put the same amount of weight down in gold as Steve reminds him of the saying but it doesn't seem to be the right amount. Poison starts spewing out from Frog faces on the wall as the gate slams shut, we roll initiative.</p>
									
									<p>Yormash flies across the pit to pick up Jack and brings him back to the front by the gate where everyone else was watching. Yormash then Misty Steps past the gate back outside. Fitz uses Vortex Warp to get Jack out of the room and on the other side of the gate. Steve Dimension Doors himself and Fitz out as the last two people in the room. As we're all outside Jack notices the puzzle cube is not in his hands and we can see it on the pedestal again. After taking a short rest and talking to Orvex, we find out that Jack put too much weight down on the pedestal. Jack and Steve decide to go in and try again knowing the correct amount of weight in gold. Fitz and Yormash stay on the outside of the gate as Steve decides to Thunderstep with Jack to the pedestal. Jack smoothly grabs the puzzle cube as he places down the correct weight in gold and then Steve Thundersteps Jack and himself back. We head back to the Shagambi Shrine to get ready for the night.</p>
									
									<p>As we're heading back, we ran into 11 Ghouls and a Ghast. We killed all of them pretty quickly and we noticed that the Ghast had the mark of Raz Nsi on it's forehead. Fitz finds two rubies worth 10 gold each. We continue back to the Shrine for our long rest. All three watches were uneventful. The next day we see the weather looks like thunderstorms so we use the Alchemy Jug to create water. We decide to go through the buildings on the left side of the raised path, one row of buildings at a time. After many buildings we approach a camp. We see a campfire ring, three moldering tents, along with a scrap of dirty yellow cloth from a flagpole in the center. It looks like everything is moldy and seems like months old. Fitz starts going through the tents and finds 50 gold pieces, a potion of healing, and a letter signed by Lord Brixton to Rue in a fancy script.</p>

									<p><i>Rue,<br>Devlin has a lead on the Eye of Zaltec! The old goat found an obelisk to the north that masks the entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. The Eye must be within, but the door is magically locked. We think the secret to opening it lies in the holy shrines.<br>We've headed into the ruins to check them out: Gods willing, we'll be back tonight. Ras Nsi's serpent people are on the prowl, so be careful. If you get into trouble, sound the swan horn twice and we'll come running.<br>For the Yellow Banners,<br>Lord Brixton</i></p>
									
									<p>The Yellow Banners are an adventuring band who found Omu a couple months ago. The Eye of Zaltec is what they were searching for. There's a rumor it is said to have the power to raise the dead, but does this exist? The session ends around lunchtime.</p>
