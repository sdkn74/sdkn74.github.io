									<p>As we're setting up camp Hew and Oflan took first watch. We heard a rustle in the bushes and a 6ft human fell into our camp. Hew and I wake the others and kinda grill him about who he is and why he's here of all places. He starts asking us questions back and we ask if he's heard of the Soulmonger. He mentions that he has and Orolunga might be a place to get more information. He mentions that he was kinda roped into trying to help while he was in port. We decide to test his mettle to see if we think he'll help out the squad instead of holding us back. Jack throws some rations in the air and Merek hits each piece with no problem.</p>
									<p>The second watch is Merek and Fitz, we decide that having someone we know on watch with the new guy makes the most sense. They chit chat and Fitz shows Merek the body of Kriptek (who we're trying to revive). As Merek and Fitz talk about crafty stuff a vine reaches from the shadows and tries to get Fitz's leg. As he avoids the vine Merek notices the vine as well and they then roll initiative for the fight. During the first round they yell out to wake up the rest of the party.After killing the vine the second watch finishes with the Steel Defender mended and Fitz getting healed.</p>
									<p>Third watch is Jack by himself and he smells the overwhelming stench of death and hears the shuffling of feet. He quietly wakes us all up and both myself and Merek notice 9 Ghouls and a Ghast. The Ghast is leading the ghouls and it has a blue triangle tattooed on it's forehead dictating that it served Ras Nsi (Ras Nsi was a chultan palidan and tried to conqure people with an undead army and was removed of his god given power). We fight off the undead and all collapse back into bed and somehow get a long rest.</p>
