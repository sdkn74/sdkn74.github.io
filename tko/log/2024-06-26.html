									<p>We start off the campaign with the basics of the campaign. Plaguing the land of Chult is the Death Curse. This curse causes all who die to die for good, no chance at revivify, no miracles, nothing. Our party was answering the call from  Syndra Silvane to stop the Soulmonger (a necromatic artifact) affecting Chult. We all land in Port Nyanzaru with a waterskin full of wine. The air is hot, humid, and rainy in the way a hot summer rain makes things worse and not cooler.</p>
									<p>We spend most of our time exploring the port town and taking in the sights and the town. As we explore we find out that to explore the island of Chult we'll need to find a guide and will most likely need to find a way down the river as that will be the fastest way to travel. As we learn about the guides we decide to go with Hew Hakinstone. He has no left arm and is looking for revenge against Tinder (a red dragon at Wyrmheart Mine). We had to talk to Jobal the guide "licenser" to get Hew. We agree to help him fight Tinder and then he can help us find the Soulmonger. During the town exploration we also discover the following places below.</p>
