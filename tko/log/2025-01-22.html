									<p>Oflan prays to their god to give out info on everything we are encountering so we can send this over to other people within our faith. We pack up after breakfast and we are moving up the mountain pass, we only have to go up 3 miles to get to the village. Jack and the metal defender help us less dexterous people with the rough terrain. As we're about 2 miles up the path we clear the treeline and Fitz and I see 3 different points of interest.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>South East - Heart of Ubtao (massive chunk of earth and rock hanging about 200 feet above the ground)</li>
										<li>West - Ziggarat (Pyramid) is at Orolunga</li>
									    <li>South - Wreck of the Star Goddess (shipwreck in the jungle, a wooden vessel in tree branches broken into 3 chunks)</li>
									</ul>
									<p> As we finish the final mile and approach the Ghost Village we notice that the entrance is littered with bleached bones of people. The only thing left standing past the entrance is a hut with thatch and leather over a giant dead reptile ribcage. Around the hut there is a shuffling human figure but they're moving in an almost animalistic manner. We assume this is the witch and we decide to approach (Oflan, Jack with Kriptek's body on his shoulder, and Fitz). We introduce ourselves and her face is so gaunt and old that she almost looks undead. While talking to the witch about the ceremony she says she needs us to perform a task and then gather the material ingredients for the ritual.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Kill the pterrafolk nest (south side, deal with it first)</li>
										<li>A lock of hair or some fingernails from Breakbone (not needed necessarily but definitely wanted)</li>
										<li>Need the corpse of the humanoid we're trying to revive</li>
										<li>A gemstone worth 100 gold or more</li>
										<li>A sacrifice of another live humanoid</li>
									</ul>
									<p>As we hear all this we decide to finally ask the witch's name and she say's it's "Nanny Pu'pu". Fitz asks how the ritual circumvents the death curse and she mentions that the person would be brought back to life. They wouldn't need food or water or sleep and they are not permanently brought back to life. She mentions that if we bring them back to life and solve the death curse this could be a permanent solution. The witch is asking for all of us to come to her so we can all get pointed in the right direction. We aren't sure exactly if we want to sacrifice someone so we decide to go after the pterrafolk and go from there. As we head to the south to find the nest we see a chute 70 feet back from the edge of the platue that goes down 30 feet. It's a tight squeeze but if you're a medium creature with light or no armor you can fit. Fitz uses the rope of climbing to anchor it and set 1ft knots to give advantage going back up. We decend and we find ourselves in a triangle cavern with a 30ft wide mouth out the side of the platue and goes back 60ft to the chute we are decending. We find 9 pterrafolk who are wanting to fight.</p>
									<p>After the fight we still need to investigate the cavern</p>
