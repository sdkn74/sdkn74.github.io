									<p>We spend the night in Nanny Pu'Pu's hut and while sleeping Jack had night terrors of Kriptek's death while Jack was running away in a forrest. While he kept running he saw Oflan being overwhelmed by undead, Fitz falling right in front of Jack lifeless, and hears a high pitched laughter from all around. He wakes up the next day and doesn't tell anyone anything that happened.</p>

									<p>We decide that we're going to keep going to the Wyrmheart Mine by sailing around the shore of the island like Hew mentioned to us before. As we're talking about possible areas to go after we realize that the wreck of the Star Goddess could be either a normal water ship or an air ship. We start heading back to where we stashed the canoe when we left the river and Fitz uses that time to make a new robot buddy. The weather that day is one of rain so we don't have to worry too much about water to drink. As we get back to the canoe Jack sees if his "turtle buddy" is still around. He is not (thankfully). As we look closer to the map of the Wyrmheart Mine that Hew had on him we see the name of the young dragon T'Zindelor (nicknamed Tinder).
