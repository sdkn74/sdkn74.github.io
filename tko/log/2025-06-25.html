									<p>After defeating Tinder Jack and Fitz go through the dragon's hoard. They find the following.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>12 Breast Plates (1 to Kanye)</li>
										<li>8 Helmets (1 to Kanye)</li>
										<li>9 Shields (1 to Kanye)</li>
										<li>4 Battle Axes</li>
										<li>1 Copper Jug with Jade inlays (Fitz)</li>
										<li>5 Warhammers</li>
										<li>1 Magic Battle axe (named Bob, given to Jack)</li>
										<li>1 Dragon metal gold medallion (Kanye)</li>
										<li>1 Empty gold scabbard (dismantle for 25 gp)</li>
									</ul>

									<p>After going through the hoard they also grab anything important off Oflan and Merek's bodies. They grab a cart to carry their bodies after a long rest. They then craft rafts for a viking style funeral and send them out into the bay. As this happens Yormash comes down the coast and asks them where he can find a group of people with Oflan and Hew as he's been sent by Zou to help Oflan. He mentions that he was traveling with Hew's cousin but that he's been captured by pirates. Jack and Fitz tell Yormash that both Oflan and Hew are dead and Yormash is upset that he cannot get vengeance on the one that killed them. He instead turns his vengeance towards the death curse as that is what forced them to be there in the first place.</p>

									<p>Fitz and Jack get convinced to help Yormash get Hew's cousin off the pirate ship so they start heading back up to where the canoe was stashed. As they all get close to the pirate bay they decide to take a long rest. 1st watch with Jack and Yormash was uneventful. The 2nd watch with Kanye and Robo buddy was uneventful. The 3rd watch with Fitz was very eventful as Fitz was attacked by 9 feathered dinos (small velociraptors the size of a turkey). We end up taking them all out and Yormash takes a moment to smoke with Kanye as he went down twice and seems shaken up. We get our hard earned long rest.</p>
