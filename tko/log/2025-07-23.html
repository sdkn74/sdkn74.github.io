									<p>After we get to the top of the beached ship Yormash grabs 3 of the 15 ballista bolts and kicks the other 12 on the ground. We try to stealthily head over the bridge in a 2x2 formation without too much issue. As we approach 3 doors, Jack just opens the one on the right up without checking for traps (like pirates wouldn't trap their base against intruders while on patrol). Thankfully the door just goes to a small bunk room and there weren't any traps or anything interesting in there. Yormash checks the center door for traps and allows Jack to go in after the check. Again more sleeping quarters so we move on to the next door. The final door isn't trapped either but inside we see a hooded figure in the middle of a room by an alter. Steve and Fitz very smoothly (not) try to convince him that they're part of the crew, in fact they made their own crew! That causes the figure to send a guiding bolt at Jack (which thankfully missed).</p>

									<p>After the battle with the priest Yormash opens a trunk to find a captain's hat. He decides to put it on while Jack tries to smash the trunk to the left since it seems like it's shimmering. After failing to smash the trunk open Yormash notices the magic around it and the characters in another language. Steve then casts detect magic and finds out the riddle.</p>

									<p>
										I flow like the ocean<br />
										Splashing in a red cave<br />
										Swap me to show your passion<br />
										Release me to show hate
									</p>

									<p>Yormash knows for certain that this is a riddle talking about a tongue and decides to deeply French kiss the trunk. In doing so the kiss is super sloppy and wet and the actual answer for the riddle hits the trunk (saliva, rolled a nat 20) and the trunk opens. Inside we find a potion of healing and an Amulet of Health. After that ludicrous display Fitz investigates the alter and finds it's an alter to Umberlee (The Wave Mother, a spiteful goddess). Yormash still puts a gold piece on the alter to respect her even if it's not his god.</p>

									<p>We get to the end of the bridge and find a giant wooden wall with a door in it. We decide this can't be trapped from the outside with them inside so we don't check and Jack opens the door. As Jack walks in he feels like a transparent sheet is holding him in place and two claymores try to chop Jack up but he dodges. Fight the boss pirate.</p>

									<p>After the fight Steve casts detect magic again and finds the capitan had a Cape of Mountebank on his back. We continue to search the chests and barrels and find the following.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>2nd level Scroll of Knock</li>
										<li>3rd level Scroll of Leomund's Tiny Hut</li>
										<li>600 pp</li>
										<li>300 gp</li>
										<li>2500 sp</li>
										<li>6400 cp</li>
										<li>10 Gold Bracelets (250 gp total)</li>
										<li>1 Electrum Goblet (Jack took)</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Steve and Fitz notice it's getting late and we need to leave soon unless we want to fight the 2 other ships of pirates. There is a big debate about leaving the prisoners and since we're all running low on HP/spells/healing potions we decide we can come back after the night. Fitz calls us bad people. We start cheesing it to the entrance and Yormash destroys the ballista on the way out. Steve for some reason decides to take a shit at the front gate, rolls poorly and must decide whether to finish the poo or pull up his pants and make a mess. We leave him behind to his fate and he very luckily seems to have caught back up with us. This dude is a menace. (TODO, meet up with Special K and long rest).</p>
