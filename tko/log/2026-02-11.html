									<p>We searching houses after lunch heading towards the North and Steve notices movement in a house to the right. Yormash cannot look through the window properly for some reason so Jack opens the door and sees nothing but spider webs. Yormash throws in a Nut! light and we see all four giant wolf spiders in the back two corners of the house and two packs in the back covered in webs. We fight the spiders and thankfully clear the webs out with fire but without burning the packs. Yormash and Jack each look through a pack. Jack finds an obsidian knife worth 25gp (just ornamental) and distributes out some money so he can keep it. Yormash finds a spell scroll (level 1 ice knife). We also find a couple canteens and rations in the packs which we divide among ourselves.</p>
									
									<p>As we get out of the spider hut and continue on, we're all really loud and fail to keep our voices down (3/4 natural 1 stealth checks). Dragonbait hears something coming down from the sky and eight giant wasps swoop down. We manage to kill the wasps and take a long rest back in the house we fought the giant wolf spiders.</p>
									
									<p>First watch was uneventful. The second watch heard rhythmic thunder, then it got a little bit faster and louder. Soon the sound shakes the building, it seems it came from the direction we were heading towards. The ones sleeping even awake to hear a giant beast eating animals, but we don't hear it leave. The ones sleeping soon fall back to sleep and the rest of the watch is quiet. Third watch was thankfully uneventful. We awake the next morning and need to check the weather and the decide on our Jug creation.</p>
