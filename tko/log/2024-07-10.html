									<p>As we wake up after getting settled in we hear the town buzzing for the Dino Races. As we're going to go find a place to make wagers we're approached by a crazy guy yelling about snake men and how they are trying to revive the ancient god under the city. There are three races that we bet on.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>4 legged race (drag race style)</li>
										<li>2 legged race (drag race style)</li>
										<li>Unchained (any number of legs, attacks are allowed but they are rare)</li>
									</ol>

									<h2>Race results</h2>
									<h3>Race 1, odds on favorite is Ankey (of a D6 roll, 2-6 will mean an Ankey win)</h3>

										<li>Hadd-enouf (Hadrosaurus)</li>
									</ol>

									<br/>

									<p>As the race ends and we're celebrating our friend's victory a barrel is thrown at us and does 9 damage to Fitz and Oflan. The one who threw it was a Yuan-ti (Snake-person) and the throw seems intentional. K'lahu (female chultan) saw what happened and asked if we were ok. During our talk with her she mentioned that there is a "low life" not paying their debt to her after the race. If we can help her collect we can get 10% of the 500gp if we help.</p>

									<p>We head out to find a gladiator chultan (Taban) and once we approach his place he starts giving us a hard time and he tries to intimidate us into backing away. We aren't intimidated and Jack goes into a rage to try to intimidate him, this causes Taban to throw K'lahu off the porch and we launch into a battle.</p>

									<p>After the battle we get 1 of the 10 precious gemstones worth 50gp. On our way back we're chatting with K'lahu and we hear <a href="/tko/rumors.html">a couple of rumors from her.</a></p>

									<p>It's now dusk so we go to see Ms. Man. She says that if we're still in town in 3 days we can get a discounted heatlh potion from her for the dino race bet we helped her out with. We then head to the Thundering Lizard and Fitz get's a crossbow. We then head to sleep.</p>
