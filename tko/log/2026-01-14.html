									<p>After our long rest, we woke up with the weather being a dreary, wet day, and we made water out of the Alchemy Jug. We headed into the courtyard that had the smoldering bodies with wild dogs eating the remains the day before. We noticed that those bodies are human bodies with red robes (Red Wizards). We see a glaive in the middle of a burnt-out pyre, and we also see Yuan-ti skulls and spines. It looks like the 2 sides fought here. Next to the glaive, we see a symbol on the wall of a snake in a spiral with a circle in its jaws. Looks like the Yuan-ti attacked the Red Wizards to send a message. We look at the symbol a little bit closer and realize it's probably a religious symbol. Yormash notices that it's a symbol of Dendar, the night serpent devouring the world (this is an evil god the Yuan-ti are trying to use to bring on the apocalypse).</p>
									
									<p>Fitz hears a cry for help, and Yormash, Steve, and Fitz go to investigate. We see an old man in his forties named Orvex. He was hired by Red Wizards to explore the ruins. He can read Old Omuan. I cure him some, and he's wanting to explore the other ruins with us. We decide to go back to the first shrine we already cleared since we know it's safe. On the way we notice some Kobolds that spot us and run away. It seems the Kobolds around here go through all the shrines to reset the traps and shrines each day. As we get back to the first shrine we notice all the spears are out of the statues' hands and the pedestal that held the puzzle cube had lowered into the ground.</p>
									
									<p>The Red Wizards are looking for the puzzle cubes, Orvex says, and he mentions that he wants to go into the Tomb of the Nine Gods. We decide to question Orvex a bit about some of the things we saw at the entrance to this city. The "frog monster" from the wall at the entrance of the city is one of the Trickster Gods, also known as the Froghemoth. Unkh is the Flail Snail and the King of Feathers is the rumored feathered T-Rex that rules the city, is magical, and that any that chase him never come back. The Red Wizards are not working with Ras Nsi, but Ras Nsi is working with the Yuan-ti. Then Orvex gives us the biggest lore dump we've ever heard</p>

									<p><i>Long ago, the god Ubtao hardened his heart and vowed to weep for the people of Omu no longer. The rains stopped, the jungle withered and died, and death swept through Omu. One morning, a wise Zorbo (koala like animal typically around three feet tall, covered in gray fur, have sharp teeth, as well as sharp claws on both hands and feet) emerged from her hollow tree and spoke to the dying Omuans. To convince Ubtao of their worth, she decided to cook him a stew made from all their good qualities. Catching such virtues wouldn't be easy, so she asked a wily Almiraj (fey rabbit-like creature with a spiral horn emerging from its forehead) to help her. The Almiraj snuck recklessness in the pot, which she saw as a virtue, and Ubtao spat out the stew when he tasted it. From that day on, Obo'laka the Zorbo and I'jin the Almiraj became terrible enemies.</i></p>

									<p><i>At noon, a brave Kamadan (identical to leopards, except for the additional six snake bodies protruding from their shoulders) hopped down from her rock. She saw the evil in the Omuans' hearts and decided to lance it like a troublesome boil. The Kamadan fashioned a holy spear, but she left it by the riverbank and a crafty Grung (poisonous frog-like amphibious humanoids that lived in swamp or marsh forests) stole it. In her rage, Shagambi the Kamadan forgot all about the Omuans and chased Nangnang the Grung forever across the sky. When evening came, a wily Eblis (large, evil bird people that are intelligent, cunning, and cruel creatures, delighting in hunting and killing) stepped from his reed hut. He didn't like the Omuans, but without them he'd have no one to play his tricks on. The Eblis sent a Marsh Frog to reason with Ubtao, but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused Ubtao, so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When Kubazan the Froghemoth (massive amphibious predators with four tentacles and three eyes) returned to Papazotl the Eblis, he chased Papazotl into the swamp with his new tentacles.</i></p>

									<p><i>That night, a Su-Monster (evil primate-like creatures with innate psionic abilities) broke into Ubtao's palace and stole a pail of water for the Omuans. When the god came running to find it, the Su-Monster hid the pail in a Jaculi's (agile, tree-dwelling creatures that resembled snakes) burrow. Ubtao asked the jungle animals where his water was hidden, and Moa the Jaculi was too honest to lie. When Wongo the Su-Monster found out how Moa had betrayed him, he vowed to catch the Jaculi and eat him up. All the while, Unkh the Flail Snail (snails that had between four and six tentacles but typically five, that were kept in constant motion, swaying slowly if the creature was calm or fast if it was agitated) lived deep under the earth. The noise of the other animals fighting made her slither up to the surface, and when day dawned over her shell, the light blinded Ubtao and made his eyes water. Life returned to Omu, and the people built shrines to honor the animals who'd saved them.</i></p>
									
									<p>We head to the other shrine that Orvex mentioned to us which was right on the other side of the wall we rescued him from. As we approach Kubazin's shrine, we see an eye stalk poking out of the water. Jack tries to cast fear, and a Froghemoth jumps out of the water. Fight with the Froghemoth.</p>
