									<p>The night after the infighting Merek went hunting while Jack went fishing. Jack ended up breaking his rod and really embraced that Unlucky Foot of the West nickname. While hunting Merek saw a hog and tried sneaking up on it but stepped on a giant thorn. He yells so loud at his pain that birds fly up out of the trees and the hog runs off. On his was back to camp he ends up hunted himself by a Kamadan. He yells out for us and luckily back at camp we are able to hear him and rush out to help. After the fight we check to see if a Kamadan is in the book Volo gave us and it is not. We write down the properties of the monster. Snakes protruding from the shoulders, sleep breath attack, claw attack, bite attack, snake tails can bite, snakes are venomous. The monster could be a pack animal and could also not be, we aren't sure. Fitz extracts 2 vials of the vials of sleeping venom in the glands of the leopard head. We decide we've had enough fun for the day and head to bed.</p>

									<p>The first watch Oflan is surprise attacked by a tiny beast with wings (Stirge). As he's about to attack the small beast back he notices 7 more approaching. Oflan is drained of a lot of blood and calls out to his friends for help. During the battle Merek went looking for his +1 long bow that he doesn't have and did try to use his cure wounds as a bonus action. We end the fight a little worn but overall alright. The second watch was pretty uneventful. The third watch Jack notices Chwingas just on the edge of the clearing. He offers them his flying monkey whistle but they don't immediately take it. While Jack isn't looking he later notices that the whistle is gone and a bowl of berries in his tent and feels empowered (he now has 3 uses of darkvision).</p>

									<p>The next day the weather is misty and humid, we decide to make 4 gallons of beer with the Alchemy jug. Oflan asks Merek to speak to him now that tempers have calmed a bit and apologizes for pushing him in the river the day before. Merek also apologizes and both of them make amends and continue on. Oflan is looking out for the ruins and/or the city of Omu. As we continue on the river Merek gets a sense that something is tracking us in the air. He can't see the thing tracking us, but he doesn't get a sense of danger from the thing tracking us. We pull of the river to see if anything happens and Oflan tries to pinpoint the creature with his sense of smell. It becomes apparent the creature is smaller than we thought and as we try to figure out it's location it flies off. The feeling we get from the presence is a playful/good presence after Jack prays to Tymora about it. We decide to just continue on with our travels and later notice all our packs have been switched with one another's. Fitz laughs it off and calls out that this was a great joke. Turns out we had a Donny the Fairy Dragon appear in the air next to us (size of a medium dog) and loved that we enjoyed his tomfoolery. Since we were so willing to play along with him he said he would answer three questions for us. We asked for the location of the Soulmonger and found they were also guarded by Gargoyles and Yuan-ti. We then ask for the location of the ruins we were keeping an eye out for and found out they were up by Orlongu. Finally we ask for any weaknesses for Tinder. We get a lot of information but not a lot on weaknesses. We find out that they're immune to fire, have a fire breath attack, they are strong, they have blindsight and darkvision. They have great CON, WIS, DEX, CHA, and STR abilities plus they have a Kobold army helping them. After thanking Donny he up and left while we put information about the Fairy Dragon to Volo's guide (side quest complete but going to try for more).</p>

									<p>We carry on with our trip and notice the river picking up speed again. This isn't quite waterfall levels of speed thankfully. On the bank we notice a human torso looking like it crawled from the treeline toward the river. Jack isn't particularly interested in checking it out but Fitz and Oflan are interested. The human looks to me a couple of days old and we see a crest of a flaming fist on his breastplate. In his pack were 4 rations, a sleeping bag, a charter of Lord Onovan IV of the Dales, 50gp, and a wand. Oflan gives last rights over the body and feels Zou give him a feeling that he's on the right path. Before we get back into the canoe Fitz casts Identify on the wand to determine it's a Wand of Wonder and Oflan ends up taking the wand. We get back into the canoe and prepare for the rest of the afternoon/day.</p>
