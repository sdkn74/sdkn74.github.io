									<p>After taking the canoe close to the Jahaka Bay entrance and getting our long rest we get up in the morning to find the weather is very close to storming. Since we have the canoe and the rain catcher Fitz and Jack show Yormash the Alchemy Jug by creating mayonnaise. They try to convince him there is an initiation where you have to slather yourself in the stuff for the first day you're with them. While Yormash is convinced to do it he's worried that time is of the essence and get's Jack and Fitz to head toward the bay. Yormash helps fix the camouflage on the canoe and we head back into the bay with a +5 buff to our stealth checks.</p>

									<p>As we enter the bay the rain starts slowly but quickly turns in to a torrential downpour that helps hide our canoe and sounds as we make it to the mouth of the river. We decide to stash the canoe and make the rest of the journey on foot to get close to the mouth of the cave. Kanye, still a bit shaken, decides to hang with the canoe while we go on ahead.</p>

									<p>After we make our way through the forest we're greeted by a giant 15ft wall and gate to prevent people from approaching the cave. A pirate on top of the wall notices us and tells us to scram, as we're heading back to the forest the pirate talks in hushed tones to another pirate and the other pirate leaves. Yormash decides to tell Jack and Fitz that he can get to the pirate and on the other side of the wall to let them in through the gate, and that now is the best time to get in before even more pirates gather. Jack agrees and Fitz is hesitant but goes along with the plan.</p>

									<p>As Yormash and Jack approach the pirate again and Yormash is asking for directions to get around the base. Once he and Jack are close enough Jack rabbit hops up to the top of the wall and Yormash Misty Steps to the top. We enter battle with Fitz taking down the pirate with his hand crossbow. Yormash and Jack quickly get down the wall, open the gate, get Fitz in, then quickly close the gate again. As we're finishing closing the gate we hear more pirates approaching. Jack and Yormash decide rushing them is the best idea and Fitz hangs back to support with his ranged weapon.</p>

									<p>We enter battle against 4 more pirates, quickly defeat them and a last minute thug with Yormash getting hit by an arrow from Fitz. We burst into a door in the ship next to us to prevent being seen by more pirates and find out it's a bar with 2 thugs (1 with a pet dino), 5 bandits playing poker, and 2 more passed out. Yormash asks to get dealt into the poker game and another fight breaks out. We kill all but 1 bandit (yes even the dino that attacked us and Jack wanted to befriend). That 1 bandit is threatened by Fitz to take us to the prison and we'll let him live. He keeps talking about his wife, husband, family, and house (which are odd things for a pirate to care about but we don't really notice).</p>

									<p>We sneak into a boat and go across a bit of water to a prison that is a bunch of bars in front of a small indent in the rocks. There's no way out except by boat so they're mostly secured even if there were no bars holding them in place. As we get to the prison Robo buddy and the bandit ("No Name") hold the boat so it doesn't blow away while Jack and Fitz knock pins out of the hinge. Yormash finds Steve (Hew's 2nd cousin twice removed) whom he traveled with to find the party. We don't have room on the boat for all 10 prisoners and someone pushes a small child into Yormash's arms to take with him. As he inspects the child when they're back on the water Yormash realizes that the kid is really a halfling ("Pepperjack") trying to get away from his pimp back in prison.</p>

									<p>On our way back No Name keeps talking about how he doesn't want to die and just wants to see his family when we finally piece it together....PIRATES DON'T HAVE A HUSBAND, WIFE, FAMILY, AND HOUSE JUST OUT IN THE WOODS! We realize No Name is just saying whatever he can to stay alive and we press him about his "family". He cracks and says he just doesn't want to die so we decide we're going to send both him and Pepperjack out the gate when we get back on land so neither one can accidentally or intentionally alert the pirates. After escorting them both through the gate we head back into the ship on land to collect some supplies and begin our journey through the boat to get to the pirate boss. On the way Jack finds a Ring of Animal Influence and Yormash stores 2 servings of boiled shark when they pass the kitchen. </p>
