									<p>History of the temple: Early days of the world a Chultan wanted to cross the river but was scared. The crocodile asked the man why he was scared. The man said crocodiles scared him. The crocodile offered to carry the man across the river for a favor and the man reluctantly agreed. The favor the man had to return was to carry the crocodile across to the realm of man which took years. "We will never like crocodiles again" said the man.</p>

									<p>We start going into the temple and we barely make it in before Jack and Oflan fall into a trap. We notice the next one though and avoid it. We come up to a 7 foot wall and help each other over. As we approach the top we see notches in the walls to our left and right where blades look to come from (another trap). A few of us try to pass and Hew reminds us to remember the story of the Crocodile and we decided to put each other on our backs and walk across with no problems. We get to and over another 7 foot wall and make it to the 3rd floor. We have to look at a mirror image of our floor and check for which way to go. We do 4 checks and make it to the next ledge. We see a door with a 4x4 pattern (buttons within the pattern). We press 4-3-3-1 to match our checks across the ground. We see a glyph show up and get Thunderwave cast on us. We decide we need to press all the buttons at the same time with the two people on top of others hitting the top two row's  buttons and the two people on the bottom pressing the bottom 2 row's buttons. The door opens.</p>
										
									<p>We walk in to a 20 foot by 40 foot room with a central pillar. The pillar is 30 feet tall with a beautiful ceramic jug on top. Jack finds a really well preserved femur from a dinosaur next to the pillar (it was used as a club). The pillar has depictions of the man and the Crocodile along it's surface. Fitz casts detect magic and notices the jug is magical. Kriptek picks up the jug and we walk back down the stairs around the pillar. Kriptek drops the jug and Jack picks it up, the room starts to fall apart as we reach the bottom of the stairs. We all run out of the temple and meet back up with Hew. As we're showing off the new jug we hear an arrow thud nearby and find 8 goblins and a goblin chief to fight.</p>
										
									<p>Batiri Goblins attack us and after killing them we look at and inspect the jug more. We find out that it's an Alchemy Jug with 10 possible liquids. The liquid comes out at 2 gallons per minute up to the liquid max. No long rest as we're going to roll for night encounters.</p>
