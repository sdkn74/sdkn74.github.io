									<p>We head towards the track from the room where we fought all the people and as we get towards the Northwestern side of the mine we see a dim glow. We go into the room with pillars and Jack fails to notice anyone before he gets attacked. Since we're in torch light we don't have any trouble fighting the 8 winged Kobolds. We continue on into the room towards the north and take a short rest while Kanye gets healed up. We continue down the tracks and with it being so dark we use a congo line strategy to keep in line with those who can see.</p>

									<p>As we get closer to the bottom of the mine there is a loud waterfall which helps muffle our steps. We decide to go into the small pocket on sublevel 2 to poke around. We find 4 wooden masks and 4 dyed Red Dino skins. Jack grabs them and we put them on as we head towards the bottom of the mine. Merek stays on the ledge with Kanye to get an advantage point on Tinder. Oflan stays outside the room with Tinder while Jack and Fitz go in to try to talk to her. It's not looking good so Jack starts to rage and the battle pops off.</p>

									<p>The battle is won but not without casualties. Oflan and Merek don't make it and the others barely survive after Tinder takes us all down with her breath weapon attack.</p>
