									<p>We head back into the canoe and head down the river, it's about midday. When it get's closer to evening the river levels out in altitude and the water seems to be quicker than it was previously. We end up letting time get away from us and pull off the river around dusk (on the right side of the river, old habits and all). Since the lighting was pretty minimal our campsite is about 10-15 feet from the water backing right up to the jungle. Jack tries fishing but is really struggling while Merek crafts arrows. The first watch is luckily uneventful as Oflan just gets lost in the view of the trees as he just stares into the jungle. Second watch Merek is thankfully alert since Fitz is in the zone "crafting" though nothing approaches camp. Third watch Jack is focused on night fishing but realizes as the sun comes up that he's not holding a fishing rod and it's just a similar sized stick.</p>

									<p>The next day is just a steady rain kinda day, we still end up using the Alchemy Jug for water though. About mid-morning Fitz and Merek see raindrops just suspended in the air further down the river (totally not odd). They then notice that webbing is holding up the raindrops and Fitz sees 4 giant spiders (2 on the left bank and 2 on the right bank). Merek tries to light his arrow on fire but catches his bow string by accident. Jack takes the human skin sack, ties it to the top of his warhammer, then lights it on fire. He throws the sack-hammer at the web and manages to catch it on fire (in the rain no less). As we end up passing by where the web used to be one of the spiders launches web at Fitz. When Oflan and Fitz see the web coming they both attack the spider. The spider seems no worse for wear but Fitz gets restrained by the web. As Merek helps to get Fitz free from the web, Jack and Oflan see a fork in the river. They're a bit conflicted on which fork to go down but decide to go to the left. Once we're on the new part of the river the speed is picking up even more than before. We use the speed to make some good time and the rest of the day is uneventful. We do find a nice little bank for camp and when we empty the rain catcher we have enough water for 2 days.</p>

									<p>As we're setting up camp Oflan looks around for threats and falls into a thorn bush. Fitz casts mending on Mereks bow to help him out. Jack fishes a couple of sunfish but as Jack is trying to file their teeth to trick Volo and put them in the book they slip out of his hands and go back into the river. We all get ready to rest for the night and the first shift is not great for Oflan. He doesn't notice a giant constrictor snake attacking. We end up killing the snake and Oflan heals up quite a bit in case more battles come up. The second shift is uneventful but the third shift Jack and Robo-Buddy hear a gropu of people coming form up river. Jack notices 10 figures that don't notice him, but he knows they will notice camp when they get closer. The figures are 1 hooded figure in the middle with 3 guards in front and 3 guards in back. They are all followed by 3 skeletons a bit further back. As the hooded figure notices camp he strikes up a conversation with Jack and is asking about Omu (ruins/city around here somewhere). He mentions that his name is "Thatcher the mage" and he was sent by Velendra Shadowmantle and that if we find anything out about the death curse or this city to reach out to the group at the Heart of Ubtao.</p>

									<p>After the long rest we start the day with the Alchemy Jug making some acid for us as we have water and it's a stormy day. We notice blue mist starting to approach the river from the left bank and we realize that the blue mist is going to hit the middle of the river just as we would be going through. We decide to pull off for a bit to allow it to pass before trying to go down the river again but Jack wanted to try to rush through and loses his oar. As we're on the bank we notice that we're at the very top of the altitude of the river and we realize that to get back down to sea level we either have to go down a big waterfall or multiple smaller ones. Oflan goes searching for a large branch then gives it to Fitz so he can create a new oar for Jack. Merek goes about 300 feet down the bank and (while not seeing the actual waterfall) thinks that we can survive any waterfall based on how high up we are and the land level below. As we're approaching the waterfall Fitz and Oflan want to pull off to assess what's below while Jack and Merek want to just go over the waterfall and handle things as they come. We can't come to an agreement to Oflan and Fitz jump out of the canoe to get to shore while Jack and Merek go over the edge. The canoe team ends up getting to the bottom without any major incident and the swimming team gets to shore. Upon getting to shore Fitz realizes that he has Featherfall and casts it on Oflan and himself so they can jump to the shore below. As we all get together we argue over what happened and how we're not working together well and can't come to an agreement on choices. Merek bumps into Oflan during the argument and Oflan pushes him back into the river. Merek barely gets out of the river before a swarm of Quippers attack him. We set up camp while Fitz mends the canoe. Oflan regrets losing his temper and realizes this is not following the path Zou has guided him on and as he prays he feels that Zou is listening and he feels like he has the inner peace and strength within himself to help bring the group together.</p>
