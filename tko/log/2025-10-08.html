									<p>Before we head out Yormash prays to Zou and notices the Guardian Amulet sticking to his armor above his heart while Artus and Dragonbait start to stretch and warm up for the trip ahead. Jack notices Artus has some tattoos that say Byrt and Lugg (one on each arm). We start heading out and the marching order is Jack, the rest of the group with Yormash following up. As we travel we find a few patches of yellow wild flowers. We hear shuffling and moaning from an outcropping and we see 12 Zombies.</p>

									<p>After the fight Fitz and Steve try to pick a flower with Mage Hand and get within 30 of the patch only to end up charmed. They walk right next to the flower patch and then they break out of the charmed condition. They realize where they are and rush away from the flowers before they touch them. They warn the rest of the group and we keep an eye out for dangerous flowers moving forward. Later in the day we see 2 giant flower stalks with each having a red, yellow, and orange blooms. We realize that these are a type of plant creature and as long as we stay out of their territory they won't come after us.</p>

									<p>As we keep avoiding them it's about time to start looking for camp. We decide we don't want to camp around all the dangerous plants so we decide to push through the night and take a level of exhaustion. In the morning we use the Alchemy Jug for water and we have to traverse through terrible storms again. A couple hours later we find a spot to relax and take a short rest. As we're packing up Jack and Yormash notice 6 Dinos chasing a wild boar. They stop when they see us and come to attack us.</p>
