									<p>We wake up the next morning to the storms finally breaking. We create water using the Alchemy Jug. As we get to the edge of Omu we see a guard house at the entrance of the city. Jack sneaks up to the house and tries to peek inside. He sees vines, rubble, and an older already put-out campfire. Artus and Dragonbait lead us into the guard house and we see 8 phrases graffiti'd (some paint, some etched) on the wall.</p> 
									<ul>
										<li>Fear the fangs of Ras Nsi!</li>
										<li>Erik, I’ve gone in search of the nine shrines. V.</li>
										<li>The puzzle cubes are the key.</li>
										<li>Beware the frog monster!</li>
										<li>Who is Unkh?</li>
										<li>All hail the King of Feathers!</li>
										<li>The snakes are not what they seem.</li>
										<li>Kubazan = bravery. Shagambi = wisdom. Moa = ?</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Jack goes ahead and investigates buildings down the road while we keep some distance but most are empty. Yormash casts Divine Sense as the party in the back is going down the street but doesn't sense anything. Jack moves to the next couple of buildings and can't see in one of them, but he does see that the other is abandoned. Fitz checks the first house Jack couldn't see in and sees it's abandoned as well. We think about the phrases again. We conclude that the nine shrines represent the nine trickster gods as they tricked the town into worshiping them instead of the main original god (the townspeople didn't know they were trickster gods, just thought they were new gods). The original god got upset and left which caused the other worshipers to start infighting over which god is the best. Unkh is one of the trickster gods. King of Feathers doesn't ring any bells even on a high roll. As we approach another hut it's abandoned, but we all minus Yormash see a Vegepygmy tribe sacrificing a Grung into the lava. The tribe is dancing and celebrating and we stay back as they throw the Grung in. A few of the worshipers get caught up in the ceremony and jump in the lava themselves. There are five Vegepygmy left plus a chief and the chief's pet. Steve approaches them and tries to strike up a conversation but they don't speak common. The chief tries to poison Steve with spores, and then the rest of them each prepare a sling ready each fight.</p>
									
									<p>During the fight Jack cast fireball catching himself and Steve in the blast. After killing them we throw them in the lava. Jack continues ahead and we find a walled off courtyard. Tall monoliths flank the entrance depicting images of jaguars with six snakes coming out of their shoulders. We notice there is a stone door on the shrine in the middle. The shrine is for Shagambi, the god of wisdom. We then determine another phrase from the wall telling us the names of 3 of the gods. Yormash's Divine Sense doesn't catch anything while Steve ritual casts Detect Magic. Jack sneaks in the courtyard and tests the shrine door. It's unlocked but too heavy to move on his own. Jack notices carvings in a language he doesn't understand. Fitz feels like it's old Omu'ian (like an old English style language would feel to our modern language). Two jaguars attack Jack as he tries to enter.</p>
									
									<p>After the fight with the jaguars we then enter the shrine. The first thing we notice is four statues not holding spears even though they look like they should. We try to put spears in their hands and nothing happens. There's a grate in the middle of the floor looking over a pit below. Past that on the floor we're on is an empty pedestal and a picture of the jaguar with snakes in a relief behind the pedestal. We go to the floor below. There are bars blocking the pit entrance, but medium creatures can get through. Fitz, Jack, and Yormash see a trap in the middle of the pit room and Fitz determines it goes around the other side of the pit down a hallway. Jack goes to investigate and sees four clay looking golems holding four bronze spears and shields, each in their own cell. We prepare in case they activate if a spear is taken. Jack and Yormash end up pulling a spear out of the hands of a golem but it magically reappears in the golem's hand. We plan to press the trap and prepare to fight them if they come down the hallway after pressing the trap. Artus and Fitz are above planning to shoot from above while we prepare actions when they come down the hallway. We press the trap and wait. We hear the sounds of the gates opening and use our readied actions on the golems as they enter the pit. Fight to be continued in the next session.</p>
