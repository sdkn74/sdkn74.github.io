									<p>We start the session on the river and Merek notices the river is getting faster like the last time we approached a waterfall. We are paying attention this time and make a plan for the upcoming hurdle. Fitz casts feather fall while Oflan casts bless on the party. We end up making it holding the boat as we fall slowly to the river below. We find ourselves in a giant gorge (Ataaz Kahakla) while Fitz realizes that the gorge is worn down and suddenly remembers that the Wreck of the Star Goddess is in fact an airship. We keep on down the river and exit the gorge and find a forested area across the river from an unnamed mine. We decide to rest for the night. 1st watch is uneventful, the 2nd watch Merek hears multiple footsteps and wakes us all up. We see 12 tribal warriors with a blue triangle on their foreheads (cannibals, tribe of eating Dhjebooty). They are heading up towards Orolunga and ask us some questions. We are vague on where we're going and eventually they leave. The 3rd watch is also uneventful.</p>

									<p>The next day is very rainy and we decide to create 4 gallons of beer with the Alchemy Jug. We decide to enter the mine and Fitz uses magic tinkering to give items of ours 5 feet of bright light and 5 feet of dim light for the non-darkvision people. We're not going stealthily at all and Oflan doesn't smell any undead. We start going down a tunnel and find a big open cavern with a dim light glowing all around the room. The floors are flooded with a sharp outcropping with sharp pipes. The pipes are shooting water our into the pools which create large waves. We hear a "Sup, dudes?!" which echos around the room. Standing on a rock is a black Kobold in the waves as we enter the room. He says that he's into body surfing and if we want to get past him we need to take part in a competition (winner take all). As we line up to body surf Jack launches a sleep vial at the Kobold and he falls unconscious.</p> 

									<p>After we survive the waves and the competition the Kobold tells us about some pirates that hang out in the bay. They have a ship at their home base, a ship patrolling the water, and a ship in the bay. Jack takes himself to the switch to open the door and then gets two critical successes to get back to the Kobold and us. The Kobold introduces himself as Kanye and says that he ows us a wookie life debt. We ask him to teach us how to be better in the water (water checks)</p>
