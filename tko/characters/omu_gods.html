										<h1>Ubtao</h1>
									</header>

									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>Ubtao (pronounced: oob-TAY-oh) was the patron deity of the isolated region of Chult and indeed the Creator of Chult and Founder of Mezro. The Father of the Dinosaurs stayed distant from both mortals and other deities, and he seemed to be above the daily doings of the world and his followers. This might have been partly due to his origin as a primordial, (his alleged betrayal of them owing him his title as The Deceiver) and it remained unclear if he was even a deity in the traditional sense.</p>

										<h1>Primal Spirits</h1>
									</header>

									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>Primal Spirits were incarnations of the natural world that were linked to specific natural features or locations in the Prime Material plane. They varied greatly in appearance and power. Some spirits were diminutive in size and might—often called upon for aid by travelers in wilderness―while others were venerated as semi-divine beings or even gods unto themselves.</p>
