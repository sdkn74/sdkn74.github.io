									<h3>Backstory</h3>
									<p>Same as Oflan, Yormash serves the god Zou. As a boy of 9 his parents were with him on a boat fishing when it was destroyed by an ill tempered giant dragon turtle. He was found floating in the see and Zou picked him up and the community on Zou's back raised him. He took an Oath of Vengeance when we became a paladin were he still resides at 23. As Zou was kept in the loop about what was happening on Chult, Zou sent out Yormash to help give Oflan help with the physical battles he was fighting. When he landed in Port Nyanzaru he found Steve, Hew's cousin. They both decided to travel together to find Oflan and Hew when they were attacked and held by pirates in the Jahaka Bay.</p>
