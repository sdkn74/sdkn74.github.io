									<p>Oflan grew up with loving parents on the edge of poverty. Due to Oflan's bigger than normal size he was often the target of bullying. One summer my mother had a vision from Zou of my future and she sent me off to the nearest temple to become a devout follower. While he grew up he used his words and mediated between people to help solve conflicts. Having been bullied in the past he was hesitant to resort to violence but he also learned that sometimes you had to fight to protect yourself or you loved ones. Oflan spent most of his time helping the community until Zou showed him a vision of a person in need, Syndra Silvane. I was instructed to help her but to also give reports back to Zou so that if more assistance is needed they can send help. I met up with her and with a few other travelers and we've been tasked to help clear the island of the Death Curse.</p>
