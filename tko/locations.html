									<h2>Camp Righteous</h2>

									<h2>Camp Vengeance</h2>

									<h2>Mbala</h2>
									<p>A town located atop a sheer plateau northwest of the Aldani Basin in Chult. Unlike most towns in Chult, Mbala is located far inland and is more than 50 miles from either the Soshenstar or Tath rivers. The plateau that it lay upon was 1,800 feet tall and its base was surrounded by heaps of huge boulders.</p>

									<h2>Ataaz Kahakla</h2>
									<p>Ranging in height from 50 to 200 feet (15 to 60 meters), the cliff face was lined with many rows of coral. Although dead, the coral kept its colors, making for a multicolored display that seemed as if the cliff was underwater. Amidst the coral were also whole skeletons of sea creatures, including giant sharks and plesiosaurs.</p>
